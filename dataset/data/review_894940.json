This game is at the best of both worlds. \n\n[u]Pro(s)[/u]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Lovely Pixel Art:[/b] Overall graphics are simple and awesome\n\n[*] [b]Calming and Peaceful:[/b] Audio track induces really chill vibes, no stresss\n\n[*] [b]Paced and Relaxed Storyline:[/b] Straight to the point storyline - The game revolves around you being the hero after defeating the dark wizard and rebuilding your very own town. As day passes in the game, there will be new variants such as new townfolks, town objects and items, depending on what you do in an in-game day. There is no rush into anything and you can take your time to figure things out (playing at a pace you like can essentially prevent grinding xD)\n\n[*] [b]Simple Movement & Customisation:[/b] The building mode in the game is reliant on mostly 4 arrow clicks (up,down,left & right)/WASD and spacebar for placement or removal of different town objects, making it relatively easy for players\n\n[*] [b]Exploration:[/b] Countless adventuring to unlock various maps, items, structures and meet travelers\n\n[*] [b]Character Upgrades:[/b] You get to upgrade your skills through building, cooking, farming, mining, woodcutting etc.\n\n[*] [b]Interactive:[/b] Get to know the background of different townfolks through day-to-day interaction, although i must admit the dialogue with them gets repetitive after some time.\n\n[*] [b]Thrill:[/b] Hunt for rare and exotic items & pets and earn $$(Dewdrops) \n\n[*] [b]Fun:[/b] One thing i really like about the game is that there is a mini tarott card game in it, which really test your brain to win your opponent :D You will get to meet weak to strong opponents and you have to choose your deck cards wisely, one really entertaining element in the game to past time!\n\n[*] [b]Events:[/b] On special days, you get to encounter something different!\n[/list]\n\n[u]Con(s)[/u]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Relatively Repetitive:[/b] Some days you might find yourself doing the same thing over again and might get slightly out of mood. I recommend playing in moderation mostly, but if you have tons of tasks on your bucket list in the game to complete, then preferably you can invest more time into playing and completing them :]\n\n[*] [b]Limited Daily Energy:[/b] A thing to note about the game is that each day you have a limited amount of energy to do what you want (woodcutting, mining etc) and what you want to do might be put on a hold until the next in-game day when your energy runs out. With that said, you may have to plan what to do day to day to optimize your energy and frustration can come along at times.\n\n[*] [b]Repetitive Dialogue with Townfolks:[/b] Do not expect the townfolks to speak something different each time you talk to them. After some point of time, you are bound to notice them saying the same things over, but that cant be help since they are NPCs in general and have limitations as to their dialogue.\n\n[*] [b]Definite Minimal Grinding:[/b] Do expect minimal grinding when you buy the game. No doubt that there will be a point of time where you will reach an endless loop of grind to unlock the endgame. But of course, you can chill and take things slow ^^\n \n\n[/list]\n \nTo sum it up,  getting to chill is one of the highlighting elements in this game. I have no regrets spending money on it as i come back time to time whenever i feel like chilling.

Initially the pacing is fine, but once you get into upgrading your buildings the material costs skyrocket.  There's no combat and the fishing and farming mechanics are extremely simple and limited; the game actually hardcaps how many things you can plant, and it's a very low number even after you upgrade the limit later.  There is a semi-interesting card game you can play that's alright at least.  Character events are very barebanes, you get 3 '''dates''' per characters and they're all virtually the same beyond a few lines of dialogue.  There's a couple dozen general events between the characters that are more interesting, but just when it looks like you might see some actual character development they end.\n\nSo that leaves the town building, which is the main selling point from the game description.  And again, at first it's neat.  You have almost full control over everything, and the the UI is well designed and easy to use.  Great, right?  Except you run out of buildings that have any actual function very quickly, leaving just decorations.  Town decorations for some same strange reason cost a small fortune and usually need rare drop material to boot.  That's assuming you even get the plans you want, which are 100% RNG on whether the shops sell them.  It very quickly kills any incentive to play with the town layout, and you just grind away hitting rocks and trees hoping the next building upgrades will open up something more interesting.  They don't.\n\nIt's not all bad, it was enjoyable enough to hold my interest for a while.

Instead, this is a indie game designed to give an experience of building your world from scratch and getting close to those within it. I highly recommend it as one of my favorite farming games.

Short version: a great way to spend a couple dozen hours relaxing, but missing the parts of its key influences that might make you remember it for years.\n\nThe reason I decided to write a review at all was the NPCs. Stardew Valley played familiar gameplay favorites, not too revolutionary there... but it had sympathetic, interesting characters that stayed with you. I did not find that here.\n\nNPCs have zero to one trait: Dalton is excited and has food on his face, Busby is mean, Lilith is angry. But wait, how can an NPC have zero traits? Oh, I don't count the trait that all NPCs share: obsession over you, the protagonist. The game passes the Bechdel test with the Don Rickles defense, saying, \"I insult characters of all genders equally!\" \n\nAnd it pans out in a completely predictable way: Ash, the hapless dude-in-distress who says he \"can't keep waiting for a hero to rescue [him]\" and then moves in with an explicit desire to date is charming for being a twist on the tropes. Willow, the girl-next-door who has a Secret Past (loving you) and not-secret present (loving you) is eye-rollingly uninteresting.\n\nLike Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, when you reach friendship thresholds, you get cutscenes that, in those games, shed some light on the characters' personalities and relationships between each other. Special Moments in Littlewood seem to somehow not do that. Instead they illustrate some... sequence of events or conversation, that touches on the zero-to-one trait of one of the characters involved, but don't elaborate on them at all. \n\nTo sum it all up, the Special Moment between Busby, the snooty town chef, and Laura, the library nerd: Laura asks Busby to teach her how to cook. Busby says \"NO!!! Hero and I are the best cooks!!\" Laura asks if she can be the third-best cook. Busby says \"NO!!! Cooking is something special between Hero and I. You wouldn't understand!\" The End.\n\nWhat? So what we've learned from this is:\n* Laura is a nerd and wants to learn things (sure, I knew that)\n* Busby is an a**hole (sure, I knew that)\n* Busby is obsessed with me (he was a Littlewood NPC)\n\nMaybe there's some progression here, with Busby grudgingly taking Laura under his wing (ha). But there's only 32 Special Moments, so if we're starting here, I can't imagine we're going to get into why Laura wants to learn cooking, or why Busby doesn't want to teach her. It seems like it's just because she's a nerd, and he's a jerk.\n\nIs it worse than average video game writing? No, probably not. But it checks so many other boxes for me so well that this whiff feels more disappointing. I'll still play it for another 10 hours or so, and I'd still say it's worth playing.\n\nPROS\n\n* Dark Cloud-style town-building: I love puzzle-guided town-building way more than I think I love free-form town-building\n* cool time mechanic: no need to fret about having enough time to get home at the end of the day: the clock and your stamina meter are the same thing... which is also why you can just teleport home when you're done chopping 20 trees.\n* shorter days than SV or HM: since the days are self-paced, they can fly by once you decide what to do with them.\n* very cute SNES graphics: you see em.\n\nCONS\n\n* NPC writing\n* samey upgrades:\n* it seems like skill increases have no effect outside of gating new trees and ores you can interact with. \n* only 3 out of 9 levels of building upgrades do anything thematic at all: 6 give you some rare secondary currency.

In so many games like this, where you have bachelors and bachelorettes, you\u2019re forced to go for someone of the opposite gender and as someone who isn\u2019t straight, that can be kinda lame.

Love it! \n\n- 100% the best graphics of any game like it. They are very polished and consistent. I cannot stress this enough, the graphics tend to be what pushes me away from similar games. God bless Stardew Valley but the creator is definitely not a pixel artist. The GBA Pokemon-like style of Littlewood is pulled off well with a modern feel. Best part of the game, hands down.\n\n- The gameplay is smooth and focuses on convenience over \"realism\" in some areas. You can instantly teleport home from anywhere. You can enter \"build mode\" which lets you play God to rearrange everything about your village. There's a lot of creative freedom. You also don't need a mouse to play which is an underrated benefit. My only gripe is, while there are a lot of keybind alternatives, you cannot change the keybinds to whatever you wish. If you are used to \"E\" being the \"activate\" button then this game with totally screw with you for the first few hours. But you get used to it.\n\n- The game has depth! There are a billion things to unlock from items, villagers, decorations, places to explore, buildings and their multiple of upgrades -- it goes on and on. PLENTY of ways to make money, but it doesn't feel overwhelming. Nothing feels like it is too out of reach. There's a lot of thought into the \"late-game\" which I appreciate. There's even a Hearthstone-like card game you can play with the villagers which is a fairly difficult, rewarding, and enjoyable challenge. \n\n- Time is based on number of actions rather than a race against the clock. This is how it should be done! There is no stress. The days might go by a little too quickly but there are late game unlocks which help reduce that feeling.\n\n- The villagers are adorable, you can flirt and go on multiple dates with (almost) all of them. I also love that you can have one of them tag along with you at your leisure. They all have their personalities and requests which you can fulfill to unlock content. It takes quite a bit of time to unlock every villager so you never feel idle in that regard.\n\nI'm very satisfied with Littlewood, I see myself sinking in a hundred hours or more. There is nothing on the market like it right now.

You can destroy only one category too, say just all the flowers for instance when they've bred out of control.

I have literally everything else other than tarot monster BS maxed out yet still can't get to the 1 area because I can't get the right flowers to grow.

Seriously... f**k flowers... \n\nJokes aside I wish there was some sort of a greenhouse like place where you could easily breed the damned things, have more control over it.\n\nAnyway, other than those two things, this is a very chill very cute and fun game. It doesn't have any kind of time constraints, or dead-lines, totally stress-free. In the early game it might feel grindy and your daily energy bar may feel too little but as mentioned earlier you have all the time you need.\n\nThere's also the fact that you have an entire town which you can fully desing. One down side is that you can't customize exteriors of houses, museum, townhall or stores. You can only change colors of your own house more in the end-gameish bits. It's not a huge deal though, there are loads of decorations you can find and/or buy. When you do all your chores and talk to everyone on a daily basis, keep good relations, decorate townsfolks' houses you get useful gifts which makes things easier and more convenient. Some of the skill rewards when you cap them like gathering cooking crafting etc are very useful some of them might seem a bit mehh.

[/b]\n\n20 hours in over three days and I am loving this game. It has become a small addiction of mine.\nIn Littlewood you play a character who, now the big bad evil has been defeated, must rebuild their town. You achieve this by meeting new people who want to move in, building them houses, building and upgrading various different shops and crafting stations and participating in festivals. It follows the basic steps of other similar games but feels much more relaxing and simpler. There is a museum for collecting, a tavern for cooking, a forest for gathering, fishing and woodcutting, and a mine for mining and bug catching as well as few other locations to explore. \n\nThere are 15ish villagers who you can eventually have move into your town, and a few others characters you can meet and talk to and festivals that happen in your town on set days that you can participate in. You have skills such as farming, gathering, woodcutting and more which can be levelled up by performing the corresponding actions and rewards will unlock as you progress. Currently there seems to be no advantage to higher levels skills aside from unlocking some late game content such as the bug tree and the fishing boat but this may change as the game is developed. Blueprints for furniture and decorations are found and bought as you play and there is PLENTY of customization for your house and the other villager houses which is a huge plus as you can control what your townspeople\u2019s houses look like. HOWEVER, there is a mechanic in the game where villagers want specific items in their house, so you are kind of railroaded into them looking a certain way if you\u2019re going for 100% completion.\n\nOne of my favourite features is the level of control you have over your village. You can move everything so you can make your village look exactly how you want. This includes adding and removing water, lowering, or raising terrain, moving houses, buildings, trees, crops and decorations as you see fit. I personally went for the most efficient layout I could thing of but if you\u2019re someone who likes things looking perfect, you have that ability. Once again villagers prefer to be close or far from certain other buildings so if you are going for 100% completion you may not be able to have your village exactly as you want it. \n\nThere isn\u2019t as much pressure in Littlewood as there are in games such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley because there isn\u2019t a clock that ticks down constantly. Instead the time of day is tied to your stamina and each action advances the day. This means you can explore and talk to people freely without pressure to rush around whilst still ensuring days are a set length of time. But there are grindy elements of the game, but I feel this is a common theme in games life this. You will be going on collect quests, farming a lot of resources and upgrading buildings multiple times. Some people might take issue with this, but it is actually one of the things I enjoy most about this genre; I always have a clear goal to work towards. Littlewood feels like a simplified version of Harvest Moon with some MAJOR improvements to certain elements of the gameplay. You do not need to replant crops constantly; all crops grow back. You can save at any point, not just before bed. Inventory space is unlimited so you can forage to your hearts content. For me, these are all things I had wanted in similar games but never found. \n\nMy only big issue I have had with the game so far is the fact that things aren\u2019t very clear to you which can cause mistakes. I fed a ghost fruit I had to an animal quite early. Since then I haven\u2019t found another single Ghost Fruit so I cannot plant more to get more. I am unsure if I am missing something but as I said, it\u2019s not overtly clear you can only obtain certain items once.\n\nI\u2019ve been playing for 20 hours and there was a small lull around the 15 hour mark where the grind was heavy as I worked towards \u2018end-game\u2019 activities but once I passed it I found my enjoyment of the game peak again. I can see myself revisiting the game with each new patch and it\u2019s one of the few games I am excited to see in it\u2019s final stage. I think it has enough content to justify it\u2019s price but if you\u2019re looking for something as fleshed out as Stardew you might want to wait it out a little longer.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\nRelaxing low-pressure game. \nEasy to understand, easy to play, easy to master. \nFull village customization.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\nAchievements are a grindfest and nothing more. Hopefully this will change as the game is developed because I\u2019m not sure I want to grind 6000 of each skill to 100% the game. \nCould do with a few QOL improvements.\n\n\n[b]THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS REVIEW OF A GAME THAT IS NOT YET COMPLETE.

As currently you are forced to play a male hero, though you can customize him. \n*Allow the player to change the names of the towns folks. I'd love to make a town where all of my friends lived with me.\n*Farm animals like chickens, pigs, and sheep should not be able to request foods that you do not have. Its annoying to see the ! above their heads for multiple days.\n\nOver all. The game is great and I'm really enjoying it. Those are just my thoughts, little minor details.

Maybe it's just the level of development right now, but most of the relationships feel pretty samey outside of one or two characters.

This is not a \"Stardew Valley lite\" as some may think, this is a town builder with social elements and resource gathering and management. The building part include home decoration just like in Animal Crossing, you have to collect blueprints to build furniture and town elements.\n\nThings are a bit more interesting than the classic Animal Crossing because there are some mini-games and some mechanics to suggest you stuff to do and give you a bonus. Inside the game there is a Magic: The Gathering-like card  game, with cards you collect during gameplay,\n\nThe graphics are simple but very cute, the level of detail is lower than some other pixel art games but in my opinion it makes the game cozier. This is a great game to relax and play with your family, language is toned down.\n\nBy the time I wrote this review, the game was near release status, very playable with plenty of things to do. If the developer keeps working on this later, it will be fun to see new stuff being added while you play.\n\nI absolutely loved this game. The community around it is great and the developer is accessible and is listening to us and delivering what we ask.

A major draw is definitely the town-building tools, which you get access to basically immediately. I think the most interesting feature, and what sets it apart from other games of its type for me, is that instead of time passing steadily, your energy bar determines what time of day it is; as your character gets more tired, it gets later. The disadvantage of this is that there's no way to refill the energy bar, but what it results in is avoiding the frantic rush to get tasks done that many other farming games eventually become. Strategically spending your energy is much less stressful than racing against the clock, which perfectly suits Littlewood's easygoing mood.

I love terraforming in games and I spent most of the time just modifying my land.\n\nI'm excited to see future developments to this game!", "timestamp_created": 1593110009, "timestamp_updated": 1593110009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569102942943572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "72207851": {"recommendationid": "72207851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083550710", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1316, "last_played": 1594250887}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing and it's only getting better.", "timestamp_created": 1594097651, "timestamp_updated": 1594097651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568279445171356201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "69385971": {"recommendationid": "69385971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172404915", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3179, "last_played": 1595011762}, "language": "english", "review": "I.

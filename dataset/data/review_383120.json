That's not to say I don't play for fun. I do, almost exclusively, and I wouldn't keep checking in if I thought Empyrion sucked completely. FWIW, the building system is engaging, and exploration can be loads of fun in co-op.\n\nHowever, there's a notion going around that players are somehow unreasonable when they're critical of Eleon Game Studios or the game after X number of hours played.\n\nA certain fanboy/moderator would apparently have everyone believe that his own 16,000 hours played is somehow reflective of the immense quality of this game, and anyone who has hundreds or thousands of hours is in fact a living testimony to Eleon Game Studios' unrivaled greatness.\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, Empyrion is clunky, bug-ridden, amateurish and frustrating even at its best.\n\nI'm usually fine with that. Kenshi is one of my favorite games of all time, after all. But \"You played X hours and got your money's worth, so shut up,\" is not an argument. \n\nVersion 1.0 is not a complete game, and shouldn't be portrayed as such through deliberately confusing manipulations of common game dev nomenclature.\n\nHowever, if \"shut up\" is the official fanboy/moderator/developer position, then my official position is a negative review, and a strong recommendation to look elsewhere for sci-fi survival.\n\nFew similar games do as much as Empyrion on such a massive scale, but nearly every game I can think of does what it does, within its own scope, better than Empyrion.\n\n- The first-person mechanics are perhaps the worst I've ever seen. Playing Empyrion doesn't feel like moving around as a character, but rather gives me the sense of a camera on wheels. Animations are ugly or nonexistent for basic tasks. It would've been a damn shame twenty years ago. Today it's inexcusable.\n\n- Characters are hideous and hideously animated. Despite the first-person woes, don't even think about playing this in third-person.\n\n- Combat is an uninspired, impact-lacking mess. Weapons feel like BB guns, and even saying that feels like an undeserved insult to air rifles. If there's one single gameplay element that kills my Empyrion joy faster than any other, it's the awful, pea-shooter combat. This is unforgivable, because combat is central to the game unless you're only in it for creative mode.\n\n- The AI is rock-stupid and blatantly plays by different rules. Enemies can magically \"hack\" (take over) your base from long range if they can't reach your core, and their base and ship weapons are superior to player weapons in almost every way. Fighting against NPCs is essentially a matter of learning how to cheese. Recent attempts to create end game content have exacerbated this problem.\n\n- Unity Store assets are still commonplace. I mean ... whatever, I guess. I couldn't afford to make my own game assets, either.\n\n- Physics\u2014what physics?\n\n- Flight model\u2014what flight model?\n\n(It's been brought to my attention that I should point out there technically is a so-called flight model. Sadly, there's no real sense of mass or weight. Never was, and neither the \"flight model\" nor atmospheric engines that were added with it changed this. The same floating camera phenomenon that applies to walking/running also applies to every class of vehicle. I say this as a flight sim fan who thinks Space Engineers and No Man's Sky both did a decent fakery job with flight, and I would have been fine with something similar in Empyrion.)\n\n- Bugs. Everywhere. Various systems are glitchy.\n\n- No volumetric water. Dug a hole at the bottom of a lake? Congratulations, you've made a permanent air pocket that you can build on and live in just like on dry land. This also means you can't create a Minecraft-style backyard pond, or build a Subnautica-style underwater home. I mean, you *can* build underwater, but it's just depressing.\n\n- Canned environmental sounds, probably from the Unity Store (I can't confirm this). It's weird to be on a completely alien planet, but hear crickets and howling wolves.\n\nThis is all stuff one would expect of an ALPHA product, of course.\n\nIf you just want to build stuff or walk around on some same-y alien worlds, it's hard to say Empyrion isn't worth twenty bucks. It's huge with lots of moving parts. If you're looking for a deep game with polished (or even competent) survival and action mechanics, investing time in Empyrion might leave you some combination of irritated, bored and sad.\n\nReview subject to change, but I wouldn't bet on it.", "timestamp_created": 1596659524, "timestamp_updated": 1596883327, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2038, "votes_funny": 77, "weighted_vote_score": "0.942653834819793701", "comment_count": 102, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73861368": {"recommendationid": "73861368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339427377", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2655, "playtime_at_review": 544, "last_played": 1596936510}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e2d\u6587 We need complete Chinese!!!", "timestamp_created": 1596716649, "timestamp_updated": 1596716649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897501289844512939", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73172091": {"recommendationid": "73172091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011537516", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 181600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181600, "last_played": 1532384712}, "language": "german", "review": "Nach den wirklich guten Versionen A5, A6, A7 und zum Teil A8 ist es leider bergab mit Empyrion gegangen.\nWas habe ich damals alles reingesteckt, zig Spielstunden, noch viel mehr f\u00fcr Blueprints bauen (einen Teil k\u00f6nnt ihr noch \u00fcber mein Profil aufrufen, wobei die alten A5 und A6 Blueprints nicht mehr online sind). Quasi mind. 90% meiner Spielzeit kommen auf diese Versionen.\n\nAber was ist passiert?\nIst mir ein R\u00e4tsel. \nGeniale Prinzipien wurden \u00fcber Bord geworfen (z.B. RIESIGE Raumschiffe konstuieren...), daf\u00fcr jede Menge Beschr\u00e4nkungen (wie CPU-Limits...) etc. eingef\u00fchrt. Ja, man kann diese f\u00fcr sich selbst deaktivieren, jedoch wenn man MP spielen m\u00f6chte, oder Blueprints entwerfen, ist man quasi gezwungen das mit zu nutzen.\nOder die Flexibilit\u00e4t der Konfigurationsdatei. Haben wir uns damals gefreut dar\u00fcber!\nHatte sogar diverse Deco-Objekte und die Konstuktoren der Grossen Schiffe (CVs) f\u00fcr die kleinen (SVs) verf\u00fcgbar gemacht (sucht mal im Forum danach!). Oder die Hinzunahme der NPCs. Ja, Idee hab ich promoted! (Siehe Forum!)\n\nAber etliche dieser damals noch offenen Funktionen wurden einfach wieder rausgenommen. Warum das?\n\nDann die \"Hit-Scan\"-KI. Treffen immer (ausser Raketen). Macht so der \"Shooter-Aspekt\" Spass??\nIch nehme an, das ist der Performance geschuldet.\nPerformance. Oh davon will ich gar nicht erst anfangen... nachdem man die Reise- und Fluggeschwindigkeiten derart wieder runtergeschraubt hat, dass man fast zu Fuss schneller ist, und nein, das Motorrad ist auch immer noch nicht vern\u00fcnftig nutzbar. Oder die neue Flug\"dynamik\". Nun gut.\n\nIch kann mich noch erinnern, als ich das Weltraum-Kampf-Szenario gebaut habe (siehe Workshop), um wenigstens ein wenig \"Action\" im Weltraum zu haben. Wurde da mittlerweile was daran gemacht? Oder gibts selbst da immer noch die gleichen schlimmen Lags und Bugs (z.B. pl\u00f6tzlich erscheinende Teile des eigenen Schiffes oder der Station angeklebt an das eigene Schiff...). und FEHLENDE Action? \nJa.\n\nBugs. Ja... aber da komme ich noch drauf.\n\nAber mittlerweile gibts Sonnensysteme. Viele. \nJa, das klingt wirklich gut. No-Man's-Sky-m\u00e4ssig. Und das meine ich nicht negativ!! \nAber gibts da auch was zu tun? Oder auch No-Man's-Sky-m\u00e4ssig? Und ja, diesesmal war es negativ gemeint. \nUnd leider.... ja. Nicht wirklich mehr zu tun. \nWarum also die vielen Sonnensysteme? Elite Dangerous irgendwer?\n\nUnd dann die Community. Da will ich gar nicht anfangen zu meckern. Ein Workshop, in dem es auch immernoch immer wieder mind. ein halbes dutzend (sehr bekannte) Baumeister gibt, die ihre 5 oder gar 10 Multiaccounts nutzen um sich erstmal selber in die Top-8 (Frontpage Laufleiste) hochzupuschen. Ja, ist sowohl den Community-Mods, Admins und auch den Devs bewusst. Ihre Meinung dazu: K\u00f6nnen wir nix zu, ist Steam-Sache. Das mag zum Teil stimmen, jedoch wenn man sieht dass da selbst Closed-Alpha-Tester mit involviert sind, fragt man sich da schon, ob da nicht einfach nur deshalb nichts gemacht wird, weil weitere 10 gekaufte Kopien einfach weitere 10 GEKAUFTE Kopien sind - und man Closed-Alpha-Tester ja auch nicht abschrecken will...\nErnsthaft, ich habe selten eine solch toxische Community im offiziellen Forum gesehen!\n\nOder diese Diskussion um Pay-To-Win-Server von zumindest Devs-nahen Leuten. Schwieriges Thema, aber sicherlich nicht n\u00fctzlich und Schweigen von seitens der Vollzeit-Devs/Eigent\u00fcmern auch nicht gerade vertrauenserweckend. Ja ist schwierig, aber wenn Freelancer Kapital aus der Zusammenarbeit mit (einem) ihrer Auftraggeber schlagen, ist das auch rechtlich nicht unbedenklich; \n(aber das Thema sei nur am Rande erw\u00e4hnt, da es f\u00fcr den normalen Spieler eigentlich nicht wirklich interessant ist.)\n\nDer eigentlich Grund, warum ich JETZT eine Negativ-Rezension schreibe ist, dass nun Empyrion aus dem Alpha in den Gold-Status wechselt. \nABER NAT\u00dcRLICH ist das super! Das Spiel war lange genug Alpha! \nAber mit DEM Content, bzw. dem Mangel daran? \nWas ist mit der Story? Mit all den Dingen die uns \"versprochen\" worden sind? \n(Gut, wirklich versprochen wurde nichts, man gewann \"den Eindruck\", wurde \"heiss gemacht\"... aber wer Empyrion auch \u00fcber die Jahre verfolgt hat, hat auch gemerkt, dass die Entwickler immer wieder herumgerudert sind, pl\u00f6tzlich Dinge (selbst welche die eigentlich gut funktioniert haben) einfach wieder ausgebaut haben, und wieder einen anderen Weg eingeschlagen sind. \nJA, auch das ist Alpha. Stimmt. \nWenn man aber genau hingeschaut hat und noch tut, sieht man, das es einfach nur besonders lautstarke Minderheiten sind, die diese \u00c4nderungen wollen.)\n\nUnd die Bugs. Ja. Aber ich denke ich muss da gar nicht viel dazu schreiben, guckt einfach ins offizielle Forum in den Bugs-Diskussionen. Das zeigt genug!\n\nUnd jetzt will man in den GOLD-Status. Ja.\n(Kopfsch\u00fctteln... Doppel-Facepalm...)\n\n\nSchade. \nIch finds schade, wirklich!\nHatte wirklich gehofft, aus Empyrion k\u00f6nnte sich doch noch irgendwann mal DAS Spiel entwickeln, das ich erhofft hatte.\nJa, dies ist eine pers\u00f6nliche Rezension, keine objektive. Muss auch nicht sein.\n\nNaja, es muss ja nicht heissen, dass die Devs nun aufh\u00f6ren weiterzupatchen....\n... und wenn es sich doch noch \"entwickelt\", werde ich das hier auf jeden Fall erg\u00e4nzen und ggbfs. sogar die Empfehlung umdrehen!\n\nVielen Dank f\u00fcrs Lesen!", "timestamp_created": 1595527393, "timestamp_updated": 1595530301, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 253,

J'ai voulu tester Empyrion car il me semblait relativement complet (Enfin) pour un jeu de survie spatial. En gros, ce jeu est un mix entre No Man's sky, Avorion, Space Engineers et Ark (pour les maladies/froids etc...)\n\nGraphismes et physique du jeu:\nLe jeu, bien qu'en alpha, est relativement beau. les effets de lumi\u00e8res et d'ombres sont soign\u00e9s et on peut dire que la direction artistique de l'espace est bien ma\u00eetris\u00e9e. En ce qui concerne les bloque et les objets, on retrouve une palette de choix assez vari\u00e9 pour fabriquer son/sa propre vaisseau/base qui sera unique. Je n'ai pas de patience pour les construction bien compliqu\u00e9es mais le workshop est rempli de cr\u00e9ations magnifiques r\u00e9alis\u00e9es par des gens qui ont beaucoup plus de temps libre que moi.\nLa physique du jeu me rappelle 7d2d en un peu moins bien. On a la gravit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre en comptre, l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des structures etc. Mais il manque encore un certains r\u00e9alisme. Certains bugs envoient un bloc de plusieurs tonne en l'air comme s'il pesait 5 kg. Les acc\u00e9l\u00e9rations des vaisseaux peuvent \u00eatre trop importantes si bien qu'on dirait que vos cr\u00e9ations p\u00e8sent le poids d'une trotinette. Enfin, le personnage a tendance \u00e0 glisser sur tout ce qui existe ce qui est assez frustrant pour les phases de construction.\n\nCrafting/construction:\nLa partie fun de ce jeu. Ayant jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Avorion (que je recommande aussi d'ailleurs), j'ai eu plaisir \u00e0 crafter mes vaisseaux/bases sur ce jeu. MAIS ! Ce n'est pas facile de prendre en main ce syst\u00e8me. beaucoup seront frustr\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de devoir faire des rotations d'objets (surtout les coins de fen\u00eatres pour les cockpits aaargh...) mais encore une fois, il s'agit d'avoir de la patience car malgr\u00e9 un jeu en alpha, beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments sont \u00e0 disposition afin de faire de tr\u00e8s belles cr\u00e9ations, m\u00eame pour des gens avec aucun talent comme votre serviteur.\nJ'aime beaucoup le syst\u00e8me de carburant, d'O\u00b2 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer pour les structures ainsi que la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un syst\u00e8me de d\u00e9fense pour ces bases (que je d\u00e9taillerai dans la partie Gameplay). \nLes ressources semblent compliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer au d\u00e9but mais tout devient plus simple d\u00e8s que vous avez acc\u00e8s au Prom\u00e9tium et \u00e0 l'outil multifonction +foreuse et ensuite miner et farmer devient tr\u00e8s plaisant, et surtout pas trop long !\nB\u00e9mol: j'ai personellement  un probl\u00e8me avec le drone (F5) pour la construction, trop d'inertie dans les mouvements \u00e7a devient vite aga\u00e7ant. De plus, je ne joue pas avec le CPU que je trouve bien trop restrictif en terme de construction (un vaisseau T2 ne peut pas avoir de bouclier ou tout juste) sachant que pour les combats, il vaut mieux \u00eatre tr\u00e8s bien arm\u00e9 ET avoir du bouclier sous peine de se faire oneshot par les tourelles ennemies.\n\nGameplay:\nQue dire ? Il y a tous les aspects que j'aimerai voir dans ce type de jeu. Pas assez d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 certes, mais pour le moment, il y a tout. \n-Diff\u00e9rentes factions dans la galaxie: check\n-Interactions avec les factions avec un syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9put: Check\n-Qu\u00eates chez toutes les factions: check m\u00eame si tr\u00e8s peu nombreuses:\n-Commerces: Check m\u00eame si tr\u00e8s peu developp\u00e9 pour le moment\nLes factions hostiles viendront lancer des raids chez vous: check et c'est fun au d\u00e9but, un peu trop simple quand vous avez vos tourelles construites mais j'ai pas test\u00e9 le mode hard core pour voir si \u00e7a augmente le nombre d'ennemis\n-Galaxie g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re proc\u00e9durale\n-Des plan\u00e8tes assez vivantes avec des patrouilles de soldats de diff\u00e9rentes factions de temps \u00e0 autre\n-Possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre un pirate: check\n-Possibilit\u00e9 de contruire une station spatiale: check\n-La faim, le froid, le chaud, l'herm\u00e9tisation, la gestion des flux d'air, les meubles, la cuisine, l'horticulture, il manquerait plus que l'\u00e9levage et on a tout ce qu'il faut !\n\nB\u00e9mol: Les PnJs sont tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s....Alpha quoi, l'IA est m\u00e9diocre, les gestes sont dignes de playmobiles et c'est en gros le gros point n\u00e9gatif du jeu, on y croit presque mais pas encore. Mais je pense que \u00e7a va s'am\u00e9liorer avec le temps\n\nConclusion:\nEmpyrion me satisfait amplement pour le jeu qu'il est en ce moment. Et on voit tr\u00e8s bien le potentiel qu'il peut avoir dans quelques temps. J'\u00e9tais frustr\u00e9 de NMS caar je ne pouvait pas cr\u00e9er MON vaisseau, frustr\u00e9 d'Avorion et d'Elite dangerous car je ne pouvait pas en descendre, de Star Citizen car...voila.\nSi vous aimez la survie, le crafting personnalis\u00e9 et l'exploration, ce jeu est fait pour vous, achet\u00e9 en promo pour 15 euros, c'est un bon investissement pour le jeu qu'il pourrait devenir !\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1594818639, "timestamp_updated": 1594818639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772848427295684814", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "73864316": {"recommendationid": "73864316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026888435", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10034, "last_played": 1593327361}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Today is the day: we are leaving Early Access, starting into the post-Alpha development phase.\"\n\nSince when does post alpha = full release?!\n\nSpace legos are fun but, this is not a \"game\" yet.

I noticed that in many of the negative comments people have voiced their frustration with outdated mechanics, too many bugs, clunky combat mechanics and the list goes on. I completely understand the frustration, and I can see that these users that gave a negative review, really want to like this game. I guess the best way to sum up Empyrion, is that it's a jack of all trades, but a master of none. The developers are a very small team, and while I can only imagine how much work must go into developing such an ambitious game, the level of depth these guys have created is admirable. I mean the game has it all, survival, crafting, base building, combat, ship building, planet generation, a recently added galaxy,  factions, story, POI's, fun exploration, mining, the list goes on. I can't think of any games that has all that.\n\nWhile I also feel the frustration with outdated mechanics, bad animations, primitive first person, third-person play style, sub-par AI etc., I'm not going to give it a bad review, because no other space sims can give me the satisfaction this game does. I mean I've played No Man's Sky, X4, Eve Online, Space Engineers, Star Citizen and so on. Just considering how much budget has been poured into Star Citizen alone, I would have loved to see what Empyrion could have achieved with half that budget. Empyrion is everything Star Citizen should be, on a much smaller scale, and even though the assets are generic, I get more fun out of this game than any of the previous mentioned space sims. I guess it's because I enjoy designing ships, testing them out, then using my creations in the game to attack POI's and immerse myself in the different worlds. \n\nBecause I've come to care about the game, I'm also concerned with the developers leaving the Alpha phase, when there is so much more I would have wanted them to work on to create a game that can hold up to AAA titles. The truth is, this is the real world, and these people have lives and need to make a living like everyone else. I appreciate the amount of work that has gone into the game. Perhaps the developers feel they want to move on and work on other titles, or perhaps the game will be a continuous work in progress moving forward, ever evolving. Regardless, I'll support the developers because they gave me a memorable experience, one of the few games I can always go back to and enjoy myself. Another game that can give me as much value as this one, is yet to be created.\n\nSo I don't know if this review is helpful, but if you want to know if this game is for you, then you need to be able to deal with the following: \n\n1. Don't expect AAA title physics, firs-person/third-person control, animations, 3d designs and textures. \n2. The AI is not the most advanced, and you can exploit flaws to get the upper hand\n3. The game is very grindy like most survival titles, and you'll put in a lot of hours before even leaving the solar system if you play the game properly. Even building your own ship can take days depending on how complex you want to design it, but there are tonnes of awesome blueprints to download from the workshop to save you time in that department.\n4. Planets and POI's are not that diverse, and there are many re-used assets on them.\n5. You can't crouch\n6. You can't walk around on ships while in flight (I so badly want this feature)\n\nIf you can look past all those flaws that I think are most prominent, what Empyrion can give you is an experience where you can create anything your heart desires. Gigantic bases, massive capital ships, nimble hover bikes, hover miners, combat small vessels that you can actually use in a living world. You can make enemies or allies with the various factions, become a trader or a pirate. Build the baddest capital ship use it in the galaxy and wreak havoc. The universe is your oyster.\n", "timestamp_created": 1596673573, "timestamp_updated": 1596673573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712370514869689941", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "72649234": {"recommendationid": "72649234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134661226", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 113012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113012, "last_played": 1594599875}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game off and on since 9.0 iteration of Alpha.

I understand games need a \"time sink\" so you don't get bored in your first 200 hours, but the way time sinks have been implemented (difficulty of AI, the ship class system with difficult to obtain parts, etc) have moved the game into \"not worth the time for the reward\" category.

If you're looking for something more like Subnautica, keep looking.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has some overshadowing issues that make it feel more like a beta than a release build. There are the bugs, of course, but there's also a basic level of polish that's missing. Certain mechanics are never explained, and answers can be difficult to find even on the official wiki. Here are a few examples/tips from my short time with the game:\n\n-If you can't figure something out, look at the controls. Notably, jetpack toggle is 'J', warp drive is 'K', and save blueprint is alt+O. These are important when you find yourself floating helplessly through space without knowing why, want to travel to a different planet, or when you design a ship in creative mode to recreate in survival mode. The first two, at least, could be easily alleviated by some contextual on-screen tips, and that's the sort of thing that contributes to feeling more like a beta than a release product.\n\n-Also, pause is, uh... pause. You know, that key you forget is even on your keyboard. The game won't pause without it.\n\n-You can't swim with a weapon or tool in your hands. So when you sink like a stone and can't figure out how to get back to the surface, just hit '0' to switch to empty hands and you'll magically begin swimming. Again, contextual tips could really help here.\n\n-Radiation is never really explained. As far as I can understand it, when there's too much radiation for your suit to block, it slowly accumulates. Once it accumulates enough, you start to suffer radiation burns and/or sickness. If that happens, don't bother curing it, because you'll just immediately get sick again and have wasted your valuable item. In order to clean the radiation, you need to build a furniture (deco) block, enter the right click menu while placing it, and select one of the two showers. Taking a shower will clean the accumulated radiation. But nothing would tell you this unless you tried building decorative furniture, which is always at the top of my priority list when I'm dying of radiation poisoning.\n\n-Pay attention to the tabs on the construction menus (or every menu, really). For some it's relatively obvious, but for others not so much. Of note, there are tabs at the top of the food processor to make medicine or seeds.\n\nLastly, some more general tips that would still be helpful even if the game didn't still feel like a beta.\n\n-Finding resources on the planet's surface is time consuming and risky. As soon as you can, build a small vessel to take into space and start mining asteroids. You'll need a suit with an EVA Boost and a Drill with at least a couple Drill Charges. Use the scanner in space to find asteroids and fly around until you find one with Prometheum, then you can make all the Drill Charges you want to continue mining whatever else you find.\n\n-It's much easier to design complicated structures (like vehicles) in creative mode, then save them as a blueprint. Go back into survival mode, open the blueprint library, then select your blueprint and click the 'To Factory' button. This lets you submit materials until the blueprint is complete, then build it all at once. It's actually a very nice feature, if not that well explained.

However, there are a slew of things that make this a much less pleasant experience than it could be - notably:\n\n- Graphics, animations and everything else visual look terrible, even at maximum settings. Models are very low-quality, textures are shoddy at best and body animations are rigid and simple. Furthermore, as far as I can tell, there aren't even moving parts on most equipment, including firearms, and the reloading animation (emphasis on singular \"animation\") for handheld equipment seems to be recycled across all reloadable equipment (i.e. you'll see the same hand animation for reloading a sidearm, assault rifle and chainsaw);\n\n- Player movement feels both clunky and imprecise - another reviewer stated it well, with the first-person movement feeling like \"a camera on wheels\" rather than actual walking;\n\n- The AI is brainless, but, at least, is given aimbot when they use ranged weapons. Melee-based enemies, such as arachnids, have so far missed me 100% of the time if I just move backward continuously while firing at them. Ranged ground enemies seem to have exceedingly accurate aim, probably to compensate for the absence of any real strategy in combat other than 'sit still and wait for him to come back into view'. Turrets are also highly accurate, but, given they're computer-operated, that's understandable;\n\n- Low-quality storytelling, sub-par grammar and just disappointingly bad writing style. In particular, the 'campaign' you can embark on from the start is a joke;\n\n- Nutrition system that can inflict numerous debuffs - and zero beneficial buffs - without warning, especially if you ingest ingredients without assembling them into meals. I can understand raw meat causing food poisoning, but things like plant protein (visually shown to be things such as nuts) causing \"indigestion\" is just irritating;\n\n- Inventory icons that look like shoddy asset store placeholder art;\n\n- Very, very slow progression system that requires substantial grinding (and waiting on long crafting timers) to build anything decent;\n\n- A slew of other, smaller things that further degrade the experience.\n\nI was led to believe this game had more to offer, but I should have figured it was too good to be true at this price. I may still dig deeper into the game to see if there's anything worth living for, but, at the sixteen hour mark, I am very unimpressed.\n\nIf you do get this game, it really should be played solely for the large-scale building and exploration experience. In my opinion, the game would literally be better if the story was stripped entirely and more effort was put into the development of visuals, AI, construction, and survival mechanics.\n\nGames that actually do parts of what this game tries to do correctly would include Space Engineers (lacks galactic travel and survival/exploration aspects, but has insanely superior visuals and a much better building system), and No Man's Sky (has galactic travel, quality exploration and superior visuals, but lacks the building system of even Empyrion, let alone Space Engineers).", "timestamp_created": 1596668256, "timestamp_updated": 1596738384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665179252624511719", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73371302": {"recommendationid": "73371302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080691571", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "playtime_at_review": 10333, "last_played": 1595878832}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u30db\u30d0\u30fc\u30fb\u5c0f\u578b\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u30fb\u4e3b\u529b\u8266\u30fb\u62e0\u70b9\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u81ea\u52d5\u751f\u6210\u3055\u308c\u308b\u9280\u6cb3\u3092\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6575\u52e2\u529b\u3068\u6226\u95d8\u3001\u4ea4\u6d41\u306a\u3069\u904a\u3079\u308b\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u6ca2\u5c71\u8a70\u307e\u3063\u305f\u8d05\u6ca2\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\n\u7269\u4f5c\u308a\u304c\u82e6\u624b\u306a\u4eba\u3067\u3082\u3001\u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u30ab\u30c3\u30b3\u30a4\u30a4\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u3092\u30ef\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002\uff08\u7d20\u6750\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\uff09\n\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u6295\u7a3f\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3082\u81a8\u5927\u306a\u306e\u3067\u6570\u306b\u56f0\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u96e3\u70b9\u306f\u4e00\u90e8\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u5909\u3060\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u70b9\u3002\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u5206\u306b\u306f\u304a\u305d\u3089\u304f\u554f\u984c\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u3067\u306f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7cfb\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u304c\u5168\u90e8\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u307e\u307e\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u305d\u3053\u3060\u3051\u6ce8\u610f\u3002\n\n\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3082\u983b\u7e41\u306b\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3053\u308c\u304b\u3089\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u305d\u3046\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u3067\u3082\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3089\u8cfc\u5165\u3092\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1595876209, "timestamp_updated": 1595876209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662391543388366699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "73703148": {"recommendationid": "73703148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988559719", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 82651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 924, "playtime_at_review": 82566, "last_played": 1596651612}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein solides Survival/crafting Game.\n\nIch kann Rucky\u00b4s und Kieve\u00b4s Argumentation nachvollziehen und gebe ihnen in den meisten F\u00e4llen auch recht.

In between survival, combat and mining you'll be spending a lot of time choosing blocks to make a cool looking base and fleet of ships. Aesthetically, it's probably hands down the best sci-fi block building system around (Dual Universe is technologically superior and will probably surpass it at some point, but not yet). There's an amazing array of block shapes and many textures to choose from, so you're able to create some absolutely stunning space ships and stations if you put the work in. And if you don't have time, you can easily download from a HUGE selection of other people's creations on the game's steam workshop. There's some truly impressive work on there, make sure to have a look.\n\nThe block physics aren't quite as good. It doesn't have true moving parts like Space Engineers, although you do get a decent array of working components like lights, sensors, doors, shutters, ramps, docking feet and hangar bay doors. There's no collision damage on ships, however, so things are a bit comical at times.\n\nThe worlds are beautiful and interesting for the most part. There's a range of planet types each with a very distinctive look, although in the galaxy mode with 1000s of star systems it suffers from the No Man's Sky problem of things being very samey. But you really only need a handful of planets to keep you occupied for countless hours.\n\nThere's a decent array of creatures and races, though perhaps not quite enough, and they lack personality. It's not true what others have said that they are aimbots, although they are fairly accurate and especially without heavy armour you can die if you make a mistake very quick. Base turrets can waste unprepared ships very quickly too. But the enemies are mostly fairly easy to defeat once you work out the techniques. The AI is fairly basic and isn't very pro-active. The gunplay and survival elements are a little rudimentary overall, although it's still playable.\n\nThe resource gathering, mining, construction elements are great fun. There's a variety of ways to gather, with a good range of resources. The development team have published a lot of the configuration files for use, so there are currently a number of people tuning the game to their own tastes, and in some case publishing those changes for others. It's great to see how much the configuration options for the game have been opened up, even if there is little to no documentation.\n\nMultiplayer is by far the most fun. Working together with others and seeing their weird and wonderful creations is epic. Building a base for the entire faction and then seeing everyone's ships parked around is very rewarding. PvP is also fun even if it is very janky and quite buggy. There is quite a lot of toxicity from a small section of the PvP community in the game, but PvP is easily avoided by joining a PvE focused server. The devs appear to have lost patience with this section of PvPers and have been neglecting PvP a lot recently, which is understandable but sad. PvP is definitely the most dynamic part of gameplay with the most potential if improved.\n\nThe community is super friendly (discord, forums), but I've found the dev team is a bit inaccessible. They tend to not comment on exploit reports or suggestions, they refuse to discuss directions, and they don't currently have any roadmap. Suggestions and feedback get no love, acknowledgement or even interaction most of the time, which is a mistake for a game where the community creation and feedback is supposedly so central. They're also terrible at community management at times, apparently struggling with knowing how to deal with toxic players. But it's a very small dev team (7-8 developers I think), so this is somewhat understandable. I hope they work on this area a little, because it's quite amazing what they've achieved otherwise.\n\nThe decision making process for changes and feature decisions is bizarre at times. Sometimes they seem to have made kneejerk decisions for a playerbase popularity stunt, at other times changes don't seem to have had any community input. I think they could benefit from spending more time talking to experienced players, content creators and server managers.\n\nStill, there's a lot to do and if you like sci-fi and constructing things, this is for you.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing purchase for it's price. If you've played Space Engineers, it's that, except with much better block selection, worse physics, similar though distinct graphics, and better survival elements. If you've never played a game like this before, think Minecraft in space for grown-ups.

I've played many of the releases as well.  This game is NOT finished and is not OUTSIDE of an EA state.\n\nShame on you Eleon for trying to portray the game as something it is NOT.\n\nI've supported the progress of Empyrion since its beginning.  I've offered countless ideas, bug reports and improvement suggestions.  I've even supported this game despite the creative direction it has sometimes gone.

Players know what they are buying when they download it and KNOW it will not change in the future, other than bug fixes and maybe a map or two added.\n\nThis is a far cry from what you have in Empyrion.  There is no guarantee that what is in the game now will stay, be removed, or outright changed completely.  You don't even have your flight physics to your game complete yet.\n\nSteam's policy allows you to refund a game if you don't like it within a small time frame, but with so much up in the air with Empyrion, will I enjoy it when you have vastly changed it later?  Can I get my money back then?  That is what EA status is for and why Empyrion should stay in EA access until you have a focused design direction.\n\nWhen this game has more meat on its bones to be considered out of Early Access, I will render a review then.

Jump to now where they announce they are skipping beta and shooting right into 1.0 which is a total 180 from how they have been in the past. Instead of putting time in they decided to just launch it into 1.0 with some nonsense excuse about how \"oh it isn't going to be perfect, leaving early access just means we aren't changing any of the old features\". Yeah, not how early access typically works, developers typically finish their game first. People are trying to wipe valid points away because of the amount of playtime they have. If anything that should speak more than anything else because you have people who clearly enjoyed the game no longer recommending it. This is my warning to new purchasers to maybe wait a year and see how the game is doing and how the devs have treated it after a year of being in \"1.0\", I really have to say that with air quotes because it is 1.0 in name only. Just take a look at the sad change log they released, then go back to other major updates and look at what typical major update is. I can only assume the developers have fallen into a bad drug habit and they are trying to get as much money as possible to feed their addictions. Or they are just getting tired of working on the game. I was going to write a longer review with feature and mechanic information but I decided to call this review done early to keep in line with the developers. Don't worry though because it was a free review so you can't complain. Cost wipes away all negative feedback right?\n\nEither way, what I am saying is wait a bit before purchasing. It really does kill me to say that, I had such high hopes for this game. Hosted (broken/buggy) servers for the game, enjoyed messing with every bit of it. I never worried because the devs were on point. This is the first time in a long time I have been genuinely surprised by a development decision. I assume they know this is a dumb move too because they try to make the smallest thing look like such an amazing act.\n\n[i]\"if you bought the game at any stage, you will not have to re-purchase it for any of the upcoming releases. This has always been the case, and this will not change as well.\"[/i]\n\nThat is from their announcement forum post. So, I am supposed to be excited that since I purchased the game already I won't have to buy it again in the future? Uh, okay, thanks. That's how it works but you do you. They've said that it isn't about a lack of money which means they had so many reasons not to do it and so few reasons to do it.

This means, no matter if you are in the deepest cellar or cave, if it is night, the strongest light fixtures do very little, whereas during the day they burn out your eyes.\n-The number one way to lose your ship is it hovering above the ground out of reach. be it, because you accidentally exited too high above on one of the poles (the devs recommend cheats or savefile edits here) or because your cockpit got blown out- which throws you out, whereas the ship stays static in the air, being finished off by whatever attacked you. It also doesn't matter if you remotely remove all fuel. It'll just stay up there without fuel.\n-the blueprint system is gamebreaking. if you create your ships or bases in creative mode, you can create them out of thin air by shoving resources into an interface. not on a console, not on some sort of actual factory- no, just an interface, and out pops whatever you want after a while.\n-linux server support- something they promised since the beginning- not even remotely in sight after the release.\n-there are story components- but do you know how it looks when they just added placeholder un-voiced textfiles in an early stage of developement? thats what you get.\n\nI could go on, but it is apparent some very basic concepts are missing which just feel like early dev stage. \nNow the \"1.0\" release. \nThere is no real reason why this should be the finished product except for \"well at some point we gotta say it's released right\" oh wow. There is no new content on release. \n\nI think it is the classic case with a small indie dev team where each has their focus, but there is no person dedicated to quality control, looking at it as a whole.

Devs & The Community. \n\nOh boy!

The developers explain to you again why their will and their opinion alone is the right one. \n4.) The developers do not understand you anymore. \n\nThis is mixed with hate and insulting comments from the community. \n\nAlso the game was great and i always thought: Now just fix bugs and the game could be ready.\nBut they added more and more content, and now they have that big, but still buggy game. \n\nI will have a look at this game in the future again, but so far..

The developers are making some very unusual business and development decisions currently, so wait until it's on a 50+% off sale if you're interested as it's not worth full price yet.\n\nThe longer explanation:\n\nI must admit that it's with a somewhat heavy heart that I give this game a negative review, but the studio's development cycle is completely off according to logical business steps.\n\nI don't have a particularly powerful rig so I tend to enjoy titles that're not AAA-games due to their usual lack of need for the usual ridiculous amount of ressources. So when they with the recent update \"optimized\" the game to have even greater ressource needs without any clear improvements to graphics, gameplay, story mode etc. then I get immensely worried, despite any promises from the developer, that the game will never be completed to a satisfying, clear actual release version anytime soon if at all, similar to the developmental status quo of 7 Days to Die with no major, new things getting added.\n\nThe game is fun as is, yes. You can spend countless hours doing similar things to No Man's Sky with the only real difference being that you're able to build your own capital ships instead of buying/finding them.\n\nThe game has a huge amount of planets and solar systems to visit which can make for profitable ressource runs, yes. I find the planets far better planned out and in general put together topography-wise than NMS.\n\nThe game has an interesting, engaging story mode with plenty of variation and difference in engagements whether hostile or friendly... No. The game in its current state is almost empty of content to the same degree as NMS at release with often confusing and/or incomplete directions, plus some are located in destructable POIs, which will punish you for early exploration and loot, by getting you stuck with no way to complete the quest apart from console commands. More or less  like NMS Atlas path if the Atlas orb had developed an attention deficit disorder forgetting that most expect a interesting end-game.\n\nThe last part is not necessarily something I feel would be a huge detriment to an early access game, but with them being way too far back in their development cycle to be comfidently entering a release state soon is so utter ridiculous. It only enforces the rather recent mentality of some larger developers that \"early full release will have major bug-fixes and huge day one patches to get it working\" as a viable, consumer-friendly business model, which I disagree with completely.\n\nThat'd be the same thing as buying a house and expects a full built and insulated home with no need to have other than minor polishes and modifications added, but when you arrive to move in they're still trying to get the foundation and dimensions of the project right, letting you know that: \"The house is able to be lived in without much hassle, but they may have to tear most of it down to rebuilt it in a couple of months due to having messed up the foundation by putting too much stress on parts of it.\"\n\nThe foundation of this game has not yet hardened nor been worked enough on to be released in about a week.\nListen to the many a broken kickstarter promises and live in the wisdom that they don't owe you a thing after a release despite promises and written, non-contractual insurances, as they could in essence say: \"We feel as a studio that this game has reached the level of our original vision.\" and abandon it or turn to cheap asset flips like the Ark developer did with Atlas in order to feed the raging consumer, greatly disappointed in the dry crackers they got while being promised steak.\n\nNo beta stage means now time to polish at all as Alpha is the constuction phase. \nIf you're clever you'll wait a couple of months to see if the development cycle continues and are getting stable, regular updates to functionality, optimization, content, polish etc..\n\nThe internet is the easiest place to lie about promises, progression and goals of a project. \nSo unless the developer starts doling out monetary compensation to disappointed, paying QA testers (early access purchasers) after release, which will never happen, then do not believe a word they say or promise as they've already got your money with no obligation to give it back after you have explored their faulty mess enough to spot the systemic errors and bugs, should they cheat you of the good, working product you originally were told would be delivered.\n\nI really, really hope and believe that they'll make this what NMS should've been, but I'd rather know why they're messing with their development cycle as no beta stage should equal no buy due to the highly suspicious and unusual decision to release the game so soon. It's NOT ready for full release; at all!\n\nDon't approach it in the following weeks at all as it has started to have a bit funny smell about how the developers has responded. \nI'm not yet sure if it's fermentation for better flavor or if the game has started to slowly wither and rot from the inside.", "timestamp_created": 1596312108, "timestamp_updated": 1596312108, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58914947509765625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "73551451": {"recommendationid": "73551451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352131670", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 22509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6784, "playtime_at_review": 17942, "last_played": 1596952480}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u60d1\u661f\u306b\u57fa\u5730\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u3092\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306b\u4e57\u3063\u3066\u63a2\u691c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u57fa\u5730\u3084\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3001\u5171\u6709\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002 \n\u305f\u3060\u3001\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30b5\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30eb\u306e\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u304c\u9ad8\u3081\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3044\u304d\u306a\u308a\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u904a\u3076\u3088\u308a\u306f\u3001\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\uff06\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u3001\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3082\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u88c5\u5099\u54c1\u3092\u843d\u3068\u3055\u306a\u3044\u7c21\u5358\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u904a\u3076\u306e\u3092\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002  \u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u3084\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u9032\u3081\u3001\u304b\u306a\u308a\u6163\u308c\u3066\u304b\u3089\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u6311\u3080\u306e\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1596183967, "timestamp_updated": 1596183967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587996244430541992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "73959586": {"recommendationid": "73959586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066139149", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 14491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "playtime_at_review": 14465, "last_played": 1596917603}, "language": "english", "review": "This game WAS pretty fun, and still has one of the best building gameplay cycles of a building/survival game I've played in general, however there's tons of restrictive systems now, and while you can turn those off, it doesn't stop rare components or other such materials from eluding you.\n\nHover vessels are still worthless due to shoddy hit detection and inability to go over small rocks, unless you want to just use them as transports, however it's more fuel and time efficient to just make a single booster flying chair to transport your stuff for you.\n\nIt's generally not worth it to build capital ships as bases anymore, and inventory management is a nightmare for similar reasons.

Dead planet\n\nNingues (Snow) planet with lots of enemy drones and Snow troll looking beasts. Gets cold at night, and colder at day? \n\nAltis and Aestus (Lava) Lava planets where the closer to lava you are the more youll heat stroke out. There are more planets with lava biomes now that are know as Young worlds. These worlds are roughest. (More below)\n\nOscutune (temperate ocean world) A really beautiful paradise that attracts alot of NPcs for its lively air and water. Lots of battles to happen but good rewards.\n\nMasperon (Alien swamp planet) Originally was the homeworld of the Zirax (A12 changed that) Now theres a whole universe that takes years to wipes out. Real time years. But alien swamp planets offer alot of world game to hunt and lots of special resources.\n\nNew worlds not fully mentioned \n-Metal Planets (yes a planet completely made of ore and minerals) Usually heavily defended but Zirax anti air defenses. But its worth it.\n-Radioactive planet (A giant green ball essentially with enough radiation to choke chernobyl out.) Radiation sits around 17.8\n-Youth Worlds (Mix of super gases and on a tipping point of becoming a boiling hot planet or a super iced planet) Finding one of these worlds and not seeing any enemy faction or any faction bases anywhere does not mean your their alone...

The implementation of the space detectors and the galaxy instead of a single system are for me game changing and open up so many possibilities.\n\nIt takes time to learn of course but it's not just the building of capital/small/hover vessels and bases in survival, but you can also dig into the coding and create your own custom made planets and build your own scenario to play with. The possibilities are endless and depend only on your own abilities and imagination.\n\nThe building element of the game is extremely strong and allows you to make some awesome stuff, check out the workshop to see what people are building, some of it will take your breath away!\n\nNow there are some who would mention the CPU and weight/volume systems are bad for the game, dislike it etc etc. My take on that is if you don't like it....then don't play with those settings on. When you start the game there are a variety of different settings you can chose from. Personally I would not play without both the CPU and the weights and volumes because for me they add so much more to the game.\n\nThere is a creative game you can start which will allow you to build your vessels/bases in a fully creative way of which after you can then spawn into a survival game. This alone can be a huge time sink and a lot of fun, I find it to be a very relaxing and fun part of the game.\n\nIt doesn't stop there though, when you play a survival game you come across varies different types of planets. For example temperate, snow, dessert, barren metal. Well when you learn how, you can actually make your own which is very cool to see the end result. Once you've made your own custom planet you can decide what poi's to spawn on it to make it into a fully functional planet. You then have a choice, you can either delve into the existing default game scenario's and add it (once you've learnt how) or you can put together your own scenario.\n\nScenario building and custom planet designing does take a lot of time and you do need patience....but it is possible.\n\nThe poi's themselves you come across in the default game are largely made by the players themselves and submitted to Eleon who have chose to use them. The zirax bases and ships, the polaris outposts, the wrecks....they are all player made and you yourself can learn how to make them in the creative game mode.\n\nThe only limitation to the building element of the game....is you :)\n\nAre there bugs? Sure, are there improvements that can be made? Of course, but Eleon are very active on their discord channel and their forums.

If you're looking for an indie game with plot and depth, akin to Subnautica (but in space):  you might want to look elsewhere - this one is simply not finished yet, and is in no way what I'd consider a \"full featured game\".   \n\nThat out of the way?  I really, REALLY wanted to love this game, but there's just not enough \"meat and potatoes\" here to really keep all but the most devoted players interested.  An immersive storyline?  That doesn't exist, here - and you're given a hastily thrown together (and unfinished) set of missions, complete with bad writing and bugs.  And bugs?  Oh, there's a lot of those, since this game is very much unfinished.  Right off the bat in the tutorial / early missions, there's numerous occasions where you can (and likely will) salvage various decorative consoles, only to find out that, whoopsie, the game wants to use that asset for a mission later, leaving you with a quest marker for an object that no longer exists.  \n\nAnimations and graphics are incredibly dated, and quite a lot of things are straight-up recycled unity assets.  I could fill an entire page with the various bugs I encountered, but a few include:\n* Falling through the map\n* Water is non-volumetric, which is sorta laughable in 2020.  This means if you dig a hole underneath a lake, it doesn't fill in.  Want a water feature in your base?  Not gonna happen.\n* Enemy AI is non existent, and any ranged enemies basically have aimbot / will hit you as long as they have line of sight.  Their weapons are also way better than anything the player gets, meaning often the only way to successfully attack an enemy base is to resort to cheap tactics, essentially exploiting the game.\n\nOnce you manage to build yourself a ship to get off the starting planet, you will likely come to realize what I did, very quickly.  That is: the universe is vast and lifeless, and you quickly find yourself asking \"What's next?\".  The various empires are static, and don't have any interaction with the player aside from occasional attacks on your base.  The multitude of planets?  It's neat to check them out for the first time, but every single one is just a cookie cutter of the last; the same crashed ships to salvage, the same enemy bases that stay where they are, and no real reason for doing anything.  If you thought No Man's Sky was a lonely, lifeless universe filled with a ton of \"same-y\" planets, EGS may indeed take the cake.\n\nFinally, the last note I want to make?  The community / devs are, at least from what I've seen, generally incredibly averse to any sort of criticism, and will outright attack and insult players for having a dissenting opinion on the game.  Have a concern about a major bug, or think that a feature is missing?  Oh-HO!   A small but loyal following will come out of the woodwork to scream about how many hours they've invested, and how anybody with more than 100 hours \"got their money's worth and should stop complaining\".   It's like buying a used car, putting 100 hours into repairing it as it constantly breaks down, and being told \"Well, you clearly got your money's worth, you spend a lot of time with it!\", while completely missing the point.  IE: that time spent doing something doesn't necessarily correlate to \"enjoyment\".  \n\nTLDR: This is an alpha-grade project at best, and is not in any way what I would consider a \"full game\".  Tons of bugs, an unfinished and uninspiring main quest, a downright toxic community,  incredibly clunky UI / gameplay, and no real point to doing much, once you get a ship.

I got about 2 weeks out of it and dumped 26 hours into it.\n\nAfter leaving the main solar system I started having some issues with the gameplay - but that's fine - it's in Alpha stage still so I\"m sure these issues would be sorted out.\n\nWell, the dev recently announced that they want to push the game from Alpha, directly into fully released, no early access title on steam.\n\nLet's be clear - this game needs at least another 2 years of HARD WORK (I'm talking monthly updates or bimonthly at the very least) put into it before it could ever be considered to be a Full Game.\n\nThe system are all implemented right now, but a lot of it still feels very placeholder and janky. This game lives and breathes jank but if you can get over that it's a very satisfying space exploration simulator with cruddy building mechanics.\n\nThe AI is stupid and sloppy, the universe, while varied - feels samey, the building is cruddy because there can only be 1 type of object in each block space - including decorative items and incredibly small items - warping is done via a loading screen, gunplay is mushy and tight, the sounds are almost all incredibly low quality and clashing, the texture work is horrendous, I could go on and on.\n\nThe gameplay is arguably here, if you're into the survival craft genre. But when this game does leave early access make no mistake - it's still in it's alpha state.\n\nI believe that the dev is doing this to either: Move on to other projects and abandon this game, or to begin introducing paid DLC ala space engineers or ARC.\n\nI would not recommend this game at anything more than what I paid for it - that being about $8 CAD, nor would I recommend any paid DLC until the dev makes it clear what their intentions are in continuing the game and is more transparent with the community over why they are suddenly thinking the game deserves a \"gold\" status when it is, in fact, far from it.", "timestamp_created": 1594991372, "timestamp_updated": 1594991372, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551312446594238281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "73980021": {"recommendationid": "73980021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144131641", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2411, "playtime_at_review": 2493, "last_played": 1596899841}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein Wort : SterbensLANGWEILIG ... es fehlt an Action , man farmt tagelang nur um dann von Drohnen zerschossen zu werden w\u00e4hrend man Offline ist ...

Then the devs decided to release as full game while their latest alpha was still full of bugs and poor/empty design.\n\n- Fps combat/base raids are poorly designed. AI is dumb, AI turrets are OP on planets so you will need to dig under the base when you want to raid one on your starter planet since they most likely contain materials you need in order to progress to better ship/vehicle (which helps taking out future enemy bases). BUGS when entering pve enemy ships such as invisible walls (containerbug). No enemies on Kriel ships, which make them incredibly boring once their ships have been halted. You can enter enemy controlled trading stations, shoot them up and leave without any consequence other than reputation drop. Reputations doesnt mean much. You fight Zirax, everyone else becomes your friend, you fight Kriel and the Zirax are your friends again etc etc. You get the picture, its very easy to become friends with whoever you want in a very short time.  \n-There are errors during playing together with others (if you ignore it you can play and it disappears but if you click the message the game closes), and sloppy sync issues (i have helmet off, others see it on etc)\n- Planets are repetitive, not much to do but mine/build. Creatures are repetitive. Except planetary environment conditions, there are no real challenges found there if there are no bases. \n- It is so obviously not ready for a 1.0, but should've been alpha longer or go to beta, there are  many more design flaws and bugs. It just screams ''this is an alpha game''.\n\nI've put hours in this game yes, over the years. It was fun, but remember that was EA, meaning we test and report. Everything is expected from an EA, but when you leave EA and skip BETA you just lie and sell an unfinished product as finished. \n Its a shame, i like this game a lot, just not this move by the devs to go for a 1.0 release. Even if they end up fixing a lot of the stuff that is wrong/missing in the current state of the game, I think it is wrong that devs are allowed to do this.

They're not hating or bashing, they're level-headed and they're telling you what you're getting. Many of them enjoy the game and many of them have hundreds of hours, but are doing their due diligence by warning people that you're not getting a fully polished, professionally finished product, and they're right. They have \"not recommended\" so people can take heed and understand what they're getting into, but they still like the game, as do I.\n\nSo, that being said, I'm putting this review as \"recommended\" because I would, in actuality, recommend this game given a caveat: if you are a big fan of crafting-survival games and you don't mind something being clunky and lacking polish, it's certainly worth your time, and for 20 bucks you get a lot of bang out of it. Playing coop just makes it better. However, like the \"not recommended\" reviews, I will say that whether the clunkiness and lack of polish is a make or break to you is gonna be subjective. I don't mind it myself, because the game is large and ambitious with a small dev team and there is plenty of stuff to do on a scale few games have ever tried to approach (No Man's Sky comes the closest). The game plays totally fine for the most part, but there are tons of little things and details all over the place that will make it abundantly clear the game is in an alpha stage.\n\nIf you're wondering what you actually do: you start off on a planet in a crashed escape pod with only a few items. From there, you can gather resources, hunt for food, craft materials and objects, completely customize and build your own hovercrafts, light spaceships, capital spaceships, and bases, and you can use said spaceships to visit random planets in a procedurally generated universe (based on seed) to find other specific resources. You can build or capture space stations and use them as ports of call if you want to establish a base on every planet in on particular system and claim the entire system as your own. It does the survival-crafting thing really well, and on a really wide scale, and knowing some programming myself I can only imagine the ungodly amount of dev time all of this cost. This is why so many people have hundreds or thousands of hours, despite all the very rough edges.\n\nSo that's it. Watch some vids, see what you're getting into. It looks a lot worse visually than it plays, especially UI wise, but everyone's mileage will vary with that. If you love survival crafting stuff, this is a great time sink.

Blue skies, green fields, the most alien thing about this planet are the plants and animals look funny, then bam: radioactive fog.  Airlock doors and concrete walls? Nope, those won't keep it out.  You'd think doors that can keep air from leaking out could keep fog from getting in, but noooo. Well, you weren't going for combat yet, but you noticed the armored suit you can research offers radiation protection and a jetpack, so how about that? But you're sick and getting sicker, restart, go for the suit first, the fog shows up, yay.  Except ... the fog keeps getting stronger, your suit protects against \"2\", the fog's past \"4\" and headed for \"5\" and it looks bad. Okay, get on the impossibly-zippy hoverbike and run away!  But noooooo.  Get literally halfway around the world, it's there too. Arbitrary, senseless, unpredictable.\n\nThat seems to be the flavor of *everything* about this game.  It's a survival game, one of the first things it has you do is pick plants and make energy bars, and you can make farm plots. Okay, how do you get water?  Well, you have to make a \"water generator\" that you put down in a body of water, then you have to fuel that water generator, which slooowwwwllllyyyy makes \"water containers\" that you have to put into cargo holds where your constructor can make \"purified water\" out of it.\n\nPointless, arbitrary, senseless constraints.\n\nYou can farm native plants like spice and such, but you can't farm them in native soil or native light, you need special \"farm plots\" and \"plant grow lights\", and there must be one light exactly 2m above each 3\u00d73 set of farm plots.  But don't be stupid like me and make a greenhouse for your farm plots, because it turns out you can mount grow lights on glass but only in corners, if you try to mount the grow light on the greenhouse ceiling your constructor ghost will skitter off to the nearest wall. You can't make a greenhouse. They specifically made it impossible to make a greenhouse. Someone took the trouble to make it so you have to make the ceiling above the 3x3 farm plot out of the *right* material, and it can't be the one thing you'd expect.\n\nWell, that or they just couldn't be bothered to care.\n\nSomeone took the trouble to reply to this on a different review, pointing out that I might have inadvertently left comments off.

Things *seem* to make sense, until that just stops and it turns out the complexity and arbitrariness is the point, if there is one at all.  The complexity doesn't *enable* anything (like, say Factorio's combinators), it's not there as a stand-in or simplification for anything (like KSP's struts and such), it's just made-up hoops to jump through so you can get to the next made-up hoops to jump through until, I'm sure they'd like purchasers to believe, you get to the good stuff.

Un ambiente muy inmersivo donde sientes los peligros, la soledad y la curiosidad de un explorador espacial. Es muy bonito est\u00e9ticamente y maneja muy bien las luces y las texturas. Algunos paisajes y escenas te dejan boquiabierto, y cada d\u00eda es diferente dependiendo de la posici\u00f3n de los soles, el estado meteorol\u00f3gico, la radiaci\u00f3n, la lluvia, etc. \n\nPlanetas inmensos y totalmente abiertos para explorar, recoger recursos, construir naves, comerciar con facciones aliadas y enfrentarte a enemigos. Puedes ir totalmente por libre como yo hice o ir haciendo misiones donde ir\u00e1s aprendiendo lo esencial del juego, que no es otra cosa que sobrevivir en un mundo hostil e ir construyendo una base refugio lo m\u00e1s segura posible y naves para explorar otros planetas. \n\nNo es dif\u00edcil de aprender si te miras el manual y te quedas con las teclas para cada cosa (o si usas un mando que configuras). Pero tampoco es para ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os o para quienes son de poco pensar. Hay que tener una cierta inteligencia para descubrir algunas mec\u00e1nicas porque son infinidad de detalles y al principio puede parecerte abrumador cuando luego ves que no es para tanto. Recomiendo que veas alg\u00fan v\u00eddeo en Youtube porque hay varios gameplays muy completos en espa\u00f1ol, y a partir de ah\u00ed decidas si puede gustarte o no.\n\nEste es un juego que mezcla varios g\u00e9neros y es especialmente apropiado para quienes gustan de explorar, crear y enfrentar los peligros que surgen. A m\u00ed lo que m\u00e1s me gusta es la parte de creaci\u00f3n. Todo funciona perfecto. Luces, sensores de movimiento, torretas defensivas, ventanas acorazadas, m\u00e1quinas, constructores, bloques de diferentes materiales,...\n\nTiene tantos detalles que con las horas que llevo jugadas solo he explorado el planeta donde ca\u00ed, he construido dos bases en \u00e9l, he eliminado casi a los aliens enemigos, he comerciado con los neutrales y he ido a una de sus lunas donde hay recursos energ\u00e9ticos. Aunque parezca poco se puede montar toda una historia a partir de las cosas que te suceden desde el principio. Y me gusta ir poco a poco creando y descubriendo m\u00e1s que buscar el enfrentamiento r\u00e1pido o verlo todo de golpe.\n\nLleva a\u00f1os en versi\u00f3n alfa y puedo decir que en todas las horas que he jugado apenas he encontrado alg\u00fan bug y ninguno serio que no me haya permitido seguir la partida. Puedes guardar las partidas f\u00e1cilmente y en ninguna de las actualizaciones he tenido problemas para continuarlas. En todo este tiempo, y sin pedir ni un c\u00e9ntimo m\u00e1s a cambio, los desarrolladores han a\u00f1adido sistemas solares, m\u00e1s planetas con sus lunas, mejoras en la construcci\u00f3n y m\u00e1s. Me parece un equipo de desarrolladores de lo m\u00e1s honesto y se nota que aman el juego. Es una aut\u00e9ntica joya de la programaci\u00f3n bajo mi punto de vista.\n\nPara jugarlo no necesitas un superequipo y puedo asegurar que va fluido con detalles medio/altos en un PC de hace 4 o 5 a\u00f1os con una tarjeta gr\u00e1fica media y un procesador i5 o similar. Aprovecha muy bien los recursos.\n\nConsejo: ajusta bien el contraste y el brillo en el juego porque la calidad de imagen puede variar mucho dependiendo de estos par\u00e1metros (si pones mucho contraste no vas a ver bien en las sombras ni de noche y eso puede arruinar toda la experiencia del juego). Cambi\u00e9 de monitor (a uno con m\u00e1s resoluci\u00f3n) y tuve que ajustar para que se viera bien.\n\nSi tienes mareo por movimiento no te recomiendo jugar muchas horas seguidas y menos dando paseos. Yo sufro de eso con algunos juegos y este no me da apenas salvo alg\u00fan d\u00eda si acumulo muchas horas sin descanso. \n\nTiene juego online pero nunca lo he usado.

Still the game has it's moments.\n\nThis is truly a server host's dream/nightmare in options and possibilities. If it was intentional or not, the modding capabilities are nearly endless. Just be careful loading too many toys in the box. The engine tends to get angry when it is overworked. There are several communities out there that have taken advantage of the many possibilities. HWS being one of the largest and updated with fresh content regularly.\n\nWhile it does carry the 1.0 version, it is far from a complete package.

Features such as ship design, trade, and base building are complex and exceed the capabilities of competitors such as Space Engineers; however, combat remains stilted and trivially easy on foot and impossible in ships. The game's quests are also technically fragile, with objectives often needing to be triggered manually in lieu of a robust quest system. There is very little depth or point to interacting with NPC factions beyond completing required quests, and so the relationship system serves little purpose besides causing you inconvenience. Further, the game suffers from survival simulator syndrome, forcing you to manage health, oxygen, energy, and hunger resources separately via crafting and agriculture.\nIn conclusion, if you enjoy the proof of concept, this game might satisfy you...for a little while.", "timestamp_created": 1595310963, "timestamp_updated": 1595310963, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517104208469390869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "72954636": {"recommendationid": "72954636", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967934667", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 6821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6609, "last_played": 1595185107}, "language": "english", "review": "First thing you should look at when reading reviews for this game: The play time. If someone has spent over 1000 hours playing a game, but give it a thumbs down, then they're not exactly being honest with themselves, to put it mildly. If you spend that long doing anything, you obviously liked it at one point, even if you're tired of it now. Yes, this game is frustrating. I've been playing it for years now, on and off. I was about to look at the patch notes to see what has changed, but if I have to look then what does that tell you? It looks it's age more and more, especially the NPCs, which are actually the latest edition.\n\nBut here's why you should play it. Imagine starting off with basic tools, and building a rickety old shelter that is barely fit for purpose. Then a hover craft that lists to the right all the time and if it gets hit in the wrong place by anything, it will explode. But here's where it gets interesting - the next thing you build, block by block, is going into space. The first time you build a space worthy craft in this game, is one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I've ever had. You're so aware of just how fragile and breakable it is, because you know everything that went into making it. No other space faring game really captures the excitement, wonder and ocassionally the sheer terror of space travel like Empyrion: Galactic Survival. \n\nThe problem with this game is the scale. That's why you can look at particular aspects of it and find it lacking. That's why it warns you you have low memory with 8GB of DDR4. That's why there isn't much of a story. But it'll take you hundreds of hours of playing the game to find what's missing. And that has to be worth something, surely?\n\nBut devs if you're listening, could you please, please sort out the save system? I need to be able to save before I do something incredibly stupid, so I can learn from my mistakes. I get that some people want games to be challenging, but they don't need to be punishing.

THE SAVE system in this game is absolutely horrid. It is more like a book mark. Once you use the book mark, it is moved to your new location unless you make a copy of that bookmark every time you use it. Now that probably sounds confusing, so let me attempt to explain it. \nWhen you save the game and log out you have a bookmark save. Once you log back into the game from that bookmark, it is no longer there. It picks up the bookmark and moves it to the real time that you are now in at that very moment. So instead of having a point saved at spot A like most games, It is now spot A plus whatever you have done since you logged back in. A is replaced by real time UNLESS you \"copy\" that save that you just started at in the beginning.

There have only been a handful in the last 40 years because of my playing style preferences, starting with Wing Commander, Age of Empires, Empire Earth, Freelancer, and most recently No Man's Sky that finally replaced my old favorites.\n      Having said that, Empyrion is unique unto itself. It has features not easily found in other games of this genre. Granted that this partly sets it apart, but also it's more about how it has it's own character and style. It's not as polished as other AAA games but quite impressive in my opinion. Not sure how they pulled it off to be fair. \n     I took a chance purchasing this game and it was well worth it. Not crazy about the aliens of horror. I never liked this style. Same reason I could never keep playing X4 Foundations due to the artists rendition of the Humans and aliens - dislike that style. The humans in this game is better but the aliens are worse in my opinion. I think the artists have done a great job just not what I particularly like, but I am sure it can be appealing to the majority of players who like Zombie type games. I guess I am more of a PG rated player. and don't like projecting unfriendly images into my brain.\n     This game is definitely not for the faint of heart. It has a steep learning curve. If the developers continue refining and updating the tutorial to the best it can be they can have a blockbuster game on there hands.

It has a built in encyclopedia to help you learn things but I never look at those things, I am not that hard core.\n    Over all, if you don't mind the learning curve and willing to put the time to learn the how to's of this game. then it is well worth purchasing and supporting the developers.\n    *----- I highly suggest starting your first game to the easy setting and even set the food and oxygen so that you don't have to worry about survival and set so that the enemies won't bother you. Then go through the tutorial. In my case, after watching a few YouTube videos.\n    *----- If you don't like playing with mouse and keyboard and only like using the Xbox game controller then this game will be a challenge as it is as of this build (12). I like doing everything with my Xbox controller and never use the keyboard or the mouse. I managed to use the partial controller support and use the mouse and keyboard when I have to, but it makes the game harder to learn since you need to know the shortcut keys etc. I still haven't been able to rotate objects yet so can't build anything worth while.\n    *-----One of my gripes with game developers is not sticking to a standard so that no matter what game you play you use the same set up for the basic stuff like movement, running, etc.", "timestamp_created": 1595946009, "timestamp_updated": 1595947098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510399997234344482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "73400258": {"recommendationid": "73400258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029874690", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 79013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "playtime_at_review": 78944, "last_played": 1596915538}, "language": "english", "review": "Empyrion is a great game if you:\n\n-like Open World Games (virtually endless space and countless planets, sectors, space stations, asteroid fields to explore)\n-like Survival Games (you don't just get to fly to space, you have to work for it.

It has potential, but is full of bugs, weird UI and game design, along with a completely unforgiving environment. \n\nAs an example, I parked my ship outside a trading station and headed inside. 5 seconds later it gets attacked and completely cored out by a passing NPC ship. No problem, I'll salvage what I can and teleport back to my base. The teleport back put me 12km away from the station. No problem, I'll put something heavy on the 'W' key and come back in a while. On getting back... no ship, no station. No problem, I'll just restart the server. Salvage what's left of the ship. Oh, the cargo's completely empty for some reason? No problem, guess I just lost a bunch of stuff, oh well.\n\nWhen I first played it, I built a simple hover vehicle, drove around for a couple of minutes exploring, then got one-shotted by a bunch of mobs with rocket launchers.\n\nGame design is similarly weird. You can put turrets on hover vehicles, but not flying ships. There are a whole bunch of duplicate thrusters in the tech tree for some reason. Solar power doesn't work very well, and you're limited to 20 of them per base. Starting up, you'll get attacked non-stop by spiders and other weird creatures.\n\nPretty much everything in the game is half-assed. You can't capture enemy ships, just shoot all of their guns off, at which point they cartwheel around the planet like a strange cross between a whale and a tumbleweed. The economy is weirdly broken - you're better off building a bunch of crap like ore detectors, shotguns and chainsaws, then selling it to the local merchants for health packs and multitool charges, than building them by grinding/farming a whole bunch of parts. You can't build rep with factions by trading or taking over the bad guys bases, instead you'll need to murder a bunch of spiders in their territory. But fixed guns only; no turrets. Ship building is kinda fun, but the interface to cut+paste is so terrible that it's probably easier to just build it block by block in survival.\n\nAnd so on and so on.

It's everything I wish Space Engineers was. It's almost as good of a shipbuilder as SE, but it also has an actual game, whereas SE does not really. There's hundreds of Systems, with probably thousands of sectors to explore POIs in space, or on Planets/Moons, Mining Asteroids, or fighting other factions(NPC, or Player), Mobs, or Aliens. There's various scattered zones of both PvE, and PvP which are clearly marked, so you can carebear mining all day(like most of us), or you can try for some PvP. TBH, the PvP is perhaps a bit lacking, but they're still updating the game regularly, so it'll probably get better eventually.\n\nI bought this game on sale, convinced a few friends to buy it, even bough a couple more copies myself. And I don't regret it, I'll buy any DLC they produce aswell, as they've made quite a great game in one of my favorite genres(Voxel building) and it deserves more attention than it's been given on Steam so far imo.\n\nIf you don't like building ships, crafts, and bases, there's a feature you can use to spawn them from blueprint via factory, and go out shooting stuff or whatever it is you non-builders do. You still have to gather required ingots/materials. However if you DO like building, you'll enjoy this game a LOT more!\n\nSources: I have over 800hrs in Space Engineers, and over 500 hours in this.

Weather dynamics are great on planets, combat is good.  I am also VERY happy and impressed with the efforts and attention this game and the community of players gets from the developer.

It could offer such amazing gameplay, alone or with friends, but in the end, lets you down when it comes to AI, buggy ground clutter and a survival aspect (looking at you parasites) that is just too much to handle.\n\nThe AI is basially always using aimbot, so as long as it isn't a projectile weapon (rockets etc.) it will automatically hit you. This is probably because they didn't bother to actually programm a proper AI. You can cheese this, but it feels wrong doing so. Oh, and you can't look down straight. So when you are on top of an elevator shaft and enemies auto-aim-shot you all the way from the bottom, you can't even return fire.\n\nThe same kind of design comes with Zirax bases. These bases are littered with laser and plasma turrets, firing an endless barrage of hot death into your direction. One hit: sure no biggie, 5 hits? Well there goes your cockpit. Oh and its usually more than 4 turrets per building. So even with the most hardened steel the game has to offer, you will be shot down immediately. You CAN circumvent and cheese the whole ordeal by simply digging a tunnel to get to the base, but after your third base of doing this, it gets old... and i enjoy this game for the steam workshop and the myriad designs of ships and bases.\n\nNow you could argue: use a hovercraft vessel (HV). Problem here is the poor collision with ground clutter and trees. You try to dodge the oncoming, afforementioned barrage of heated plasma, but then you get stuck to a dead tree sticking out of nowhere... i was just piloting a 24 ton tank and a tiny stick got me busted. You can't always set yourself free from those obstacles as your collision detection makes you literally wrap around the obstacle.\n\nHow's crafting? Quite nice, and the amount of different planets, ships, blueprints and whatnot, it's all there and it is very nice, albeit a bit rough around the edges.\n\nThis is an Alpha Version that has been an Alpha for almost half a decade and i've been playing since 2018. Many things have been added, many bugs have not. \n\nI come back to this game ever so often, start a nice base, get things going and then get frustrated by how little has changed.\n\nSo as the current state of the game, i will only recommend this to the most hardcore fans of space survival. For everyone else: Wait for the BETA! or even (if that ever happens) the full game.\n\n(Besides the fact, that i've just read, that the devs are quite toxic towards open criticism on their discord)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1594309268, "timestamp_updated": 1594309268, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 501, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853113234043121338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "71083387": {"recommendationid": "71083387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342526110", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 359, "playtime_at_review": 2871, "last_played": 1595765302}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d5e\uff01\uff01\uff01\u8fd9\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587\u8bd1\u7684 \u7b80\u76f4\u8fa3\u773c\u775b \u597d\u6b79\u628a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u8ddf\u65b0\u624b\u6559\u7a0b\u7ffb\u8fc7\u6765\u597d\u4e48\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1592668562, "timestamp_updated": 1592668562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84946674108505249", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "69442260": {"recommendationid": "69442260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391017286", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 134482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 123003, "last_played": 1596233869}, "language": "german", "review": "Nach \u00fcber 2000 Stunden zieht es mich immer wieder zur\u00fcck zu dem Spiel.

Meiner Einsch\u00e4tzung nach kann man das Spiel nach ein paar Stunden schon genie\u00dfen, die Bedienung ist eing\u00e4ngig, wenn auch in einigen Aspekten gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig.

It also has a bunch of cosmetic stuff implemented at base that other games never even consider allowing you.\n\nOn top of that, while building to build is a nice enough motivation, Empyrion also goes a lot towards what you build being useful, since you're encouraged from an early stage to raid hostile bases(\"Points of Interest\") for materials and resources that may be a tier above what you already have easy access to, as well as to stop the faction(s) you choose to be hostile to, from raiding you(a classic feature of Empyrion is that your first base will receive visits from Zirax raider squads, one of their bases on the planet you're on is host to the raiders, and thus teching up to take it out becomes your first long-term goal, requiring that you get some good guns and armor and also build some hardy combat vehicles since it'll have hefty turret defenses on the outside).\n\nIn addition, Empyrion has some gorgeous graphical details in places. While the enemy models aren't all that amazing, nor, in fact, many of the environmental models, there's just something about the lighting engine that really works. The combination between the music(which is quite good) and the lighting just makes surface exploration feel oddly satisfying.\n\nIt's also a game that gets a lot of love from the developer, there's always been something in the works on the game for as long as I've owned it, and while it's not always been stuff that's immediately affected the gameplay, they haven't been afraid to get their hands dirty with fundamental under-the-hood revamps to make the game run smoother or allow future improvements without the game grinding to a screeching, smoking halt.\n\nLike all such games, though, the big caveat is: do you have someone to play with? Singleplayer just isn't going to be satisfying. But that's not really a point against Empyrion, it's just a feature of the genre, and something to keep in mind.\n\nCurrently, the thing to keep an eye out for is Empyrion revamping its progression system and on-foot combat, since they're the only ones who can, in the late-ish game, feel a bit lacking. Eventually you'll have unlocked everything you can build, and the enemy infantry combat AI is a bit... shallow.

It's a very gritty and raw sci-fi themed survival/building sim that let's you build buildings, hover crafts, star fighters and capital ships capable of warping to nearby planets within the procedurally generated star system. \n\nSurvival mode can be challenging and requires a lot of exploring and grinding to collect materials, which can be fun if you're into that sort of challenge. However it takes a lot of time to be able to build the big stuff, which means setting up sprawling networks of autominers and constantly running around collecting them. Once you get to that point, you've basically beaten survival mode and them the question falls to what do you want to build and where do you want to build it?\n\nYou can also jump straight to the building aspect with creative mode or the itemmenu catalog. There are some really impressive blueprints that people have created in the workshop, as well. \n\n***ISSUES***\n\nThe big downside is the lack of support for mission immersion. The in-game \"missions\" are just lame text boxes that nobody wants to read and you can actually turn them off because the devs know the missions are super lame or really... non-existent. They put very little into making it feel more real or at the very least, more like an adventure. The game is very stoic in that it is purely survival. There are no animations, cinematics, cutscenes or even just pictures to add to the story. You do not interact with other beings and no creature ever speaks a word. \n\nYour allies don't help you with anything and your enemies are obnoxiously weak at attacking your base. The only benefit to having an ally is that you can use their shops. But they have no ships and no troops, only buildings and land. \n\nNow personally, I enjoy building a stronghold and defending it from wave after wave of attacks in my survival games. Last time I found scenario with an ultra-hard planet and I built my base on top of a mountain, right next to a shielded enemy drone base, in their territory. Base attack level 10 with unlimited attacks. Still too easy. They could never land a single troop transport. \n\nIf the transports would land outside of range and then they come in on foot it would make more sense. Attacks also only come from one direction each time. They never flank you. Then there is the lack of diversity in how you can be attacked. The enemy only has dropships and drones. There is the occasional capital ship seen wandering around. When it's working correctly, you can knock it out quickly with a competent SV. \n\nHowever there are no HVs or SVs to battle in survival mode, although I do understand why. The devs do not prioritize AI in any way. All the NPCs are super basic. These devs seem to prioritize reflections on textures and screen flares from the sun ahead of playability and immersion. The reflections are still really buggy too. \n\n***PERFORMANCE***\n\nI'm hoping the performance improves with the next big update because it seems to have problems utilizing system resources. I have a liquid cooled custom built rig and it still has performance problems with large POIs or areas with lots of POIs grouped together. I feel like the game doesn't cache data as well as it should. The distance of view is also choppy. I hate it when a large building just appears out of nowhere because it wasn't preloaded correctly. You could be standing on a mountain looking down into a valley and have no idea there are buildings there, even with maxed settings. \n\n*******VERDICT*******\n\nEmpyrion is a fantastic game with loads of potential but is great as a survival builder in it's current form. It may not be perfect but it's the best that I've seen so far in this particular genre. I play it all the time, bugs and all. On my last survival game I found an ocean planet and built a naval base to launch a fleet of hover craft warships. I built a battleship with 3 variants along with an aircraft carrier loaded with fighters.

Well, you can build a base, and not be a hobo, but since you'll need to travel to other planets or systems for resources, you're pretty much a space murder hobo. \n\nIf you like building within a framework of rules this game is for you! There isn't anything too complicated about most of the building, in that blocks are assumed to have power wires going through them. You still need to manage things like CPU (how many things the computers can control) and weight (Yeah, you can build a ship that holds 8 million tons, but you better have the thrusters to lift it). \n\nThe Good:\nCreativity to build all kinds of things. A base, check! A horrible motor cycle that is faster than walking, check! A little (or big) ground vehicle, check! A futuristic hover tank, check! An airplane, check! A space ship, check! A large capitol wessel to carry all the other stuff in, check! An orbital space station to park your carrier, check! Defend a raid on your base(s), check! Attack other bases, check! Loot, check! Horrible space diseases that will kill you if not treated, check!\n\nThe bad:\nCombat and AI are a little weak. Hit boxes are a little janky. Very small weapon selection (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, minigun, rocket launcher, laser rifle with 2-3 tiers of each). Only 5 armors (none, light, medium, heavy, epic). Weak RPG elements, and character progression.\n\nThe Ugly:\nGraphics. Its a pretty ugly game, some things have been improved though.\n\nThe Unknown:\nI've not indulged in PvP yet. With the janky hit boxes, and fact that someone will be able to put in hundreds more hours than me, my pea shooter is probably not going to hold up well against someone else's fully armed and operational battle station. \n\nThe only game I can really compare this to is 7D2D, and we all know how fantastic that game has become. This is like space 7D2D without a set horde schedule.\n\nThis game is still early access of course, but the improvements I really like. The addition of CPU, and weight+volumes I really like! This addition has really played havoc with the workshop, but gives a sense of progression. You can't just go from a space loincloth and space club to the Aluminum Falcon any more. \n\nThe missions and quests are a little weak, but I understand the devs are working on it. The first solo mission chain is AMAZING (to me, if played as intended). It reminds me of Aliens. \n\nThe game still has a ways to go, but with the galaxy opening up soon I'm really looking forward to a nearly limitless area to explore instead of around 20ish \"systems.\" \n\nI'd really like to see some RPG elements added and a different character progression. Maybe something like more \"specialized\" skill trees. For instance, you could build the most amazing hover tank(HV) ever! But, your small ships (SV) and capitol vessels(CV) are only ok. It would give people a better reason to band together in multi-player. \n\nThe factory system is handy, but also should be tweaked. You can literally build any creation as long as the size class is supported by your server/game and have the level. I think this is a little over powered. I'd like to see something more along the lines of a physical factory facility you have to build. Lowest tier gives you access to your own creations, then one for workshop hover vehicles, another for small vessels, a fourth for capitol vessels, and a final one for workshop bases. Or even split bases into terrestrial and space. What you have access to should be limited by your skills, or pay credits(in addition to resources) for what you don't know. Maybe make NPC factory POI's (point of interest). So you have to go make friends with one of the alien races to use their factory to build that shiny new jrandall creation. \n\nI really like where this game is heading. Sure, some of the people who have been playing it longer than I are upset by some of the changes (CPU, Weights+Volumes) You can turn those features off, and build without those limitations.\n\nCPU feature: Basically, the \"computer\" of your base, hover vessel, small vessel, or capitol vessel is now limited on what it can control. All the items you add have a value that count against the CPU value. Your creation will have decreased effectiveness if you exceed the CPU rating.\n\nWeight+Volume: Basically its like this. If you put a bunch of heavy rocks in your vehicle, you need to have the power to lift and push it. Volume is like trying to put a bed in a shoe box. \n\nI say get this game, and join the rest of us on its development journey!", "timestamp_created": 1589555138, "timestamp_updated": 1589555138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671314775943756104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "70306690": {"recommendationid": "70306690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029985777", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1592769544}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego cuenta con cosas interesantes, tales como:\n\n- la gran cantidad de elementos crafteables y materias primas.\n- la sensaci\u00f3n de supervivencia que produce; siempre tendr\u00e1s que estar atento a alguno de los indicadores del personaje, sobre todo al viajar al espacio y planetas con atm\u00f3sfera no respirable, donde tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1s que gestionar el Ox\u00edgeno.\n- la gran libertad de personalizaci\u00f3n: puedes construir a tu gusto bases, veh\u00edculos, crear y destruir terreno... adem\u00e1s, si encuentras unas ruinas, puedes hacerlas tuyas en un momento.\n- puedes programar desencadenadores, sensores, etc. para que se activen ciertos elementos de las bases, tales como luces, etc.\n\nNo obstante, a d\u00eda de hoy, hay varios factores que hacen que me decante por no recomendar este juego:\n\n- los fallos del juego: muchas veces mi personaje se queda atrapado entre dos superficies, o acaba bajo el modelado del terreno.\n- la calidad y el acabado gr\u00e1ficos del mismo no son lo que cabr\u00eda esperar de un juego de 2020.

AI is dumb, enemies are super-accurate bullet-sponges  The ship-creation has some really good shapes, but they all have basically the same flight model, and it is something from an '80''s arcade game.

I didn't understand it.\n\nI returned and now, for some reason, I really fucking love it. I don't know why I didn't get it before, but I get it now.\n\nPicture this. It's like minecraft, where you build block by block. Everything in the terrain is destructible. You crash on a planet with minimal gear and you have to survive. Manage hunger, thirst, temperature, radiation, and also stamina and health and oxygen. Forage plants to make foods, cut down trees, mine from rocks or underground. That's where the game STARTS, but that's where minecraft kinda stops.\n\nYou can build your base from its shape to its size, mindful of structural integrity/caving in roofs. Maybe you have to make it airtight depending on the planet. Turn everything you forage into materials. Make windows, automatic doors, lights (with sensors/switches etc), elevators, catwalks. Upgrade your constructors, build turret defenses, manage your power and base oxygen and food stores with farms.\n\nBUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.\n\nThe planet has quests to do, and there are factions, and attacks on your base (or ships). So you'll need defenses, armor, jetpacks, weapons and ammo. Explosive devices. You'll need better fuel, more minerals. You can attack enemy bases and salvage materials, empty their chests. Loot their bodies.\n\nWE HAVEN'T SCRATCHED THE SURFACE.\n\nSo you want to fly. Ok. You can built hovercraft, or if you really want to take off, build a small vessel. You'll need the mats and the time to build all of the blocks and materials and components you need. You put down a starter block but you need to also put down the shape, the floor, the cockpit, fuel stores and engine, ?shields?, sensors, storage devices, fridge, wifi, etc. Add weapons, mining turrets. I mean, it is literally block by block. You design the shape. And use your texture tool and customize the colour, the material appearance, if it glows or not, if it's round or flat or a cone etc, each individual block. Make a small ship with a covered cockpit, or a medium sized ship with a few ramps or hatches to get inside and build a seating area, viewing deck, engine room, and bridge. Or, you know, a dock on your ship for your hover vessel to latch on to. Going into space? Ok, build better engines, oxygen tanks/make it airtight, etc.\n\nYOU'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.\n\nVisit moons, orbiting ships/wreckage, enemy patrols. Mine asteroids. Warp to other systems. All in the search for better loot, more minerals, more money, more more more. Bring your food with you. Return home your lovely base.\n\nYOU'RE STILL ONLY GETTING STARTED.\n\nBuild a starship (capital vessel) to lift off the planet and take you somewhere else. Keep your HV and SV inside your CV. Build it as big or as small as you want. Build it in space or on the planet. Outfit it with weapons or just keep it bare bones for transport and survival only. Land on a new planet, different biomes, different temperature, different difficulty, different factions, different attacks by different/new weapons. Watch out for radiation fog, frozen worlds, heat waves, and enemies at night. It gets nuts. It gets hard. Very hard. Make a new base on a new planet, or just live out of your CV. Or, you know, set up teleporters and link your bases together. Build a fleet of ships for different purposes. Small nimble bike to explore, attack ship, mining frigate, luxury cruiser, physics defying designs, and more.\n\nGOT IT YET? SEE HOW BIG IT IS?\nCustomize everything. Build it all. Explore. Loot, manage your plant farm, build solar panels, mine better fuel. Trade at the spaceports, buy exotic materials and weapons you can't build. Attack enemies and friends. Harass the wildlife. Make ugly or beautiful ships and bases. Live your dream. It's amazing. OR, import what others have built if you're not that creative, from tiny ships to starter bases, to gigantic complexes and capital starships/stations.\n\nTHERE'S MORE\nJoin the discord and check out the chat, pictures, tips and tricks. Vast youtube videos explaining how to do everything. Join multiplayer servers or play with your friends, make or play your own scenarios. Browse the expansive workshop on steam with new designs to import to your game, or upload your own design for others to play. It's really expansive, huge, and there's so much.\n\nBut it starts with foraging those plants, building that simple base, two solar panels, and your first hover vessel. It all starts there. That's only where it begins.... \n\nCONCLUSION\nIt's a big, customizable game, with mild to extreme threats. Make it as beautiful as you want or as ugly as you want. From boring concrete cubes to elaborate mountainside structures, underground safe houses, sky installations, or modular capital ships that do double duty as a landing pod/survival structure.

Elles sont faciles \u00e0 gu\u00e9rir quand on dispose des plantes/m\u00e9dicaments adapt\u00e9s mais au d\u00e9but je suis mort plusieurs fois de suite en mangeant des trucs apparemment comestibles et en bon \u00e9tat juste parce que je n'avais pas encore trouv\u00e9 les bonnes plantes/antidote. \nDans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es les m\u00e9dicaments eux-m\u00eames semblent avoir parfois des effets secondaires : Je ne me souviens plus exactement des maladies mais une fois j'ai eu un truc X (on va dire br\u00fblure par radiations) j'ai pris le m\u00e9dicament adapt\u00e9 qui a gu\u00e9ri X mais m'a coll\u00e9 un autre truc Y (on va dire une indigestion) j'ai donc pris un autre m\u00e9dicament qui a gu\u00e9ri Y mais m'a laiss\u00e9 avec encore une plaie que j'ai d\u00fb soigner avec un bandage ! Ouf ! Bug ou pas de chance je n'en sais rien.\n\nLes combats :\nPas encore beaucoup test\u00e9s. \nLes bestioles rencontr\u00e9es pour le moment sont faciles \u00e0 g\u00e9rer tant qu'on ne se laisse pas surprendre au milieu d'un pack et le fusil \u00e0 pompe du d\u00e9but a toujours suffit m\u00eame pour explorer/nettoyer une base abandonn\u00e9e.\nPour les attaques de drones j'ai juste rencontr\u00e9 ceux qui viennent attaquer la base \u00e0 un moment du tutoriel.

Par exemple il y a de l'inertie thermique et dans un environnement froid un vaisseau ou un batiment non aliment\u00e9 se refroidi et la temp\u00e9rature remonte progressivement quand on l'alimente de nouveau alors que les d\u00e9placements \u00e0 pied et les sauts ne sont pas tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis comme si il y avait trop d'inertie.\n- Les sauvegardes disparaissent quand on les utilise. Si on envisage de r\u00e9utiliser plusieurs fois la m\u00eame il faut la copier avant de l'utiliser\n- Le drone (touche F5) est disponible d\u00e9s de d\u00e9but et permet, en plus de la reconnaissance des endroits peu accessibles, d'utiliser l'objet en cours et on peut donc miner avec.\n- Le loot trouv\u00e9 dans les caisses est TRES al\u00e9atoire En utilisant une sauvegarde pour tester plusieurs fois la m\u00eame caisse j'ai eu aussi bien des armes et mat\u00e9riels d'assez haut niveau (incraftable \u00e0 mon niveau) que quelque plaques d'acier sans aucune valeur.\n\nConclusion : C'est tout \u00e0 fait mon genre de jeu et m\u00eame en l'\u00e9tat (encore un peu \"rustique\") je recommande mais il ne faut pas avoir peur d'aller chercher les infos en anglais", "timestamp_created": 1592826310, "timestamp_updated": 1592866447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576429843902587891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "71057147": {"recommendationid": "71057147", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991261547", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 21642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1488, "playtime_at_review": 1669, "last_played": 1596954393}, "language": "english", "review": "My first impression is, this is a very fun game, with many ways to enjoy a freestyle development and some quests to do as well. I am disappointed at how buggy the quests are, but there are ways around the bugs provided. The physics and environment are both very well done, and the exploration is enjoyable. \n\nIn this short amount of time, I recommend this mostly for those that have friends that they can enjoy the game with. While solo is fun, this is a game that is better with sharing the experience.\n\nI have several screenshots up already, if you wish to see some of the first steps in the game.\n\nAfter many more hours, I found myself in debate of how to consider this game. In all, my thoughts are still the same as my first impression, but I am more inclined to say this game is not for anyone going in solo. There seems to be nowhere inviting to a player who does not come in already part of a community involved in the game. \n\nIn all, this is a fun and enjoyable game but tired of starting over. \n\nThe first server I joined shut down, with over 150 hours in that server played. The second is no longer compatible after 12 hours in that one. The third server seems to be up only once in a while. The fourth server, in just 6 hours, II broke my leg on the starter planet a dozen times and every resource and area was drilled and full of new player bases with no one there.\n\nIn that time, I was told to kill myself for saying hello to a server upon joining. I was told prepare to die, threatening me when I enter pvp areas, and the only friendly community I met is now moved on.\n\nI enjoy the game, but I don't enjoy starting over again and again due to server issues and other problems. Single player is fun to a point, but does not seem enough to keep my interest. I guess that this game is not for me, since I cannot find a place in any server and don't have the patience to spend another 10 or so hours starting over. I wanted to explore the universe, and some of the modifications that these servers boasted about, but not like this.\n\nIn short, I recommend this game for people who already have friends established within the game.

Very much yes. Of all space survival/exploration/crafting games, Empyrion is my favorite by far. \n\nIs it perfect? Certainly not. The game is being developed by a small indy developer and it shows. At the time of writing, it's unpolished, to say the least: combat is quirky, performance so-so, NPC and character modeling is rudimentary at best, water acts weirds... the list goes on. \n\nBut in exchange for coping with that, you'll get a game of a scope and depth you won't find anywhere else. Explore the universe. Fly to any planet and land on it. Interact with the locals. Build bases and fully functional spaceships from scratch, using an intuitive crafting system that allows for enormous variety. Save your creations as blueprints and share them via Steam, or download and use one of the thousands designs other players made. \n\nAlmost everything in the game world can be modified: you can raise or lower terrain, build underground or under water, take over NPC bases and demolish them or alternatively, tailor them to your own needs. There are many Points of Interest to explore, ranging from derelict spaceships to ancient alien facilities. The game also caters to various play styles: you can befriend alien factions and trade with them, or go on a rampage and conquer the known galaxy. The universe is yours.\n\nAnother good thing: the team is still actively developing the game. So expect more quality-of-life improvement and possibly new features as well in the months/years to come.\n\nAs with any other survival game, Empyrion has a learning curve. If you're playing for the first time, surviving and dealing with aggressive aliens may provide some challenge and certainly will require a bit of grind. But believe me, it's doable and totally worth it once you get the hang of it.", "timestamp_created": 1596867796, "timestamp_updated": 1596867796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73958058": {"recommendationid": "73958058", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990075707", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 136081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 828, "playtime_at_review": 136081, "last_played": 1596761725}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game created and updated by a very small team (currently 5 programmers and 2 modellers) the game is highly enjoyable and constantly evolving. \n\nDo not get me wrong, this is not a game made by a multi-million studio. \nIt is a game made by a small group who enjoys the game and the community around it. \n\nThere are two things I really like about the game. \n\nFirst, the developers are open to suggestions and have modified the game multiple times based on player feedback. \nIf they introduce an unpopular feature they usually give players the option to turn it off. \nMany of the current POI's in the game were built by community members. \nIf you buy the game, make sure you log into the forums. \n\nSecond, the developers have never charged for new content.

Then you build hover vessels or flying small vessels to explore the planet. Leaving the planet and entering space for the first time is an emotional experience. The local solar system can be explored, and with time, large capital vessels can be made to explore the galaxy. \n\nThis game is special because, like Avorion, the player designs their buildings and ships block-by-block and the creative freedom is liberating. I understand that games like No-Man's-Sky and Elite Dangerous do not allow the player to design their own ships and I view this as a serious limitation. Ships you make in Empyrion must also be functional and so design and function come together in a thoughtful way. This game has sufficient first person shooter elements and when attacking various enemy bases or ships there is loot to be found. The game is packed with different mechanics such as food production via farming, oxygenation of your bases or ships, fuel management, shields, computing power, weights and volumes and more and your experience can be tailored via the difficulty settings. \n\nSeveral times my ship was shot down unexpectedly on distant moons and I was faced with the prospect of repairing my ship under hostile conditions. These were some of the best gaming moments I have had. Of course, successfully raiding a difficult Zirax base is satisfying too. There is a learning curve in Empyrion but between the built-in PDA information and public forums i was fine. Games without learning curves are made for 8 year old children anyway right?\n\nMy top three under-rated games on steam would be this: Empyrion Galactic Survival, Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever, and Crosscode. \n\nI think the developers will continue to make Empyrion better and I highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1596860914, "timestamp_updated": 1596860914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73951547": {"recommendationid": "73951547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055665505", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6172, "playtime_at_review": 5337, "last_played": 1596927900}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought game for the cost of beer, wasn't expecting much I'm not gonna lie.\n\nI got something that can only be explained as Deadspace, Space Engineers, and No Mans Sky having a baby. \n \nWe've had generators overload and explode, ships take off at INSANE speeds because we stacked to many engines in one direction, and there has been much girly screaming when clearing out what can only be described as a infested hell crawl. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1596856488, "timestamp_updated": 1596856488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73951105": {"recommendationid": "73951105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108039241", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1079, "last_played": 1562542799}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O jogo ficou muito mais pesado e mal otimizado em compara\u00e7\u00e3o ao seu acesso antecipado.", "timestamp_created": 1596855755, "timestamp_updated": 1596855755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73950948": {"recommendationid": "73950948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990946982", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 778, "playtime_at_review": 7542, "last_played": 1596942065}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best videogames ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1596855499, "timestamp_updated": 1596855499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425963491201400757", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73950615": {"recommendationid": "73950615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114885240", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 660, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1596943903}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u521a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1596854926, "timestamp_updated": 1596854926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73950583": {"recommendationid": "73950583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044153896", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 381, "playtime_at_review": 11701, "last_played": 1596870510}, "language": "english", "review": "Never had so much fun dying in the early stages of the game. its so much fun playing with a group of friends for the first time; everyone is laughing because we are all dying for one reason or another.

You also have no indication if the more complex items will or won't qualify for the required raw materials in the blueprint. \n\nAdditionally, the Factory cannot return items input into it, at all.

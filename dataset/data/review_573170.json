La mec\u00e1nica de juego de Fidel consiste en trazar el mejor camino para superar cada nivel, intentando eliminar a la mayor cantidad de monstruos en el proceso.

The point is, \u00a37.19 is asking a lot for this game.  \n\nThe game has solid controls and pleasant sound-effects but these features are not exactly hard to implement in a game of this nature. The art-style is of a good standard and the gameplay mechanics are enjoyable and well-varied. The best feature, for me, is the easy-on-the-ear soundtrack - very good!\n\n[u]And now the not so good:[/u]\n1. The default option has you play in a small box that's HALF the size of the screen. Why? Although you can play in a window, I could not get it to display so that it covered the full-screen as per the advertised screenshots (...you know...like almost every other game).\n\n2. It's quite unbalanced. There were times I pondered hard over the first four or five levels... but then - with little to no challenge - sped through the next three or four levels in a matter of seconds, reaching level 9 in no time. \n\n3. You are not kept that well informed and the progress system is very basic. It seems that the one and only goal is to reach Level 15. There is no home-page, no star-system, no path/level-select screen, no world or areas to explore and no stats. It's very bare-bones and lacks features even bog-standard mobile game developers include in their games. \n\nThe thing is, apart from crashes and game-breaking bugs, good and decent gameplay should trump everything else - and as FDR does manage to deliver in that department I have to recommend it on that basis - but I'd equally recommend that you DO NOT PAY THE full price and pick it up in a sale instead.\n\nFor hundreds of reviews of indie titles please check out or follow my website through my curator page at:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1550834513, "timestamp_updated": 1550835134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481040418148040771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49049431": {"recommendationid": "49049431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067891330", "num_games_owned": 6423, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1520238546}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple yet intriguing roguelike puzzler with great focus on level design, where you basically play the same game over and over again, yet you keep learning new facts about gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1550398453, "timestamp_updated": 1550398453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462894946336746216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48705083": {"recommendationid": "48705083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273720151", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1319, "last_played": 1580161601}, "language": "english", "review": "The amount of playable characters and game modes can seem overwhelming at first, but they're all worth it (I guess I'm still not 1000% sold on zombie dog, though).

I revisit it once in a while to complete the daily challenge or beat the main game. It never goes on too long and is always fun.\n\nOne of it's strengths is definitely it's great replayability. Since puzzles are randomly generated, two dungeons are never the same, and it has a real impact on the gameplay. Due to the various rules of each different tiles and creatures, a slight position offset may drastically change the best path to an exit. There's also many possible solutions to most puzzles, so some thought is always required even with \"obvious\" situations.\n\nOn top of that, there's some interesting special modes. They aren't as deep as the main game, but are fun enough to complete. The one I return to the most is the daily challenge, wich is not surprising. The daily challenge is a single level that changes every day and can be completed only by finding the perfect solution. It can get pretty difficult!\n\nRegarding difficulty, I'd say it is very much a casual game. The \"hard\" mode became easy fast after I completed it once, and now that the ghost timer has been removed it's a walk in the park. The daily challenge and some achievements are now the only challenging parts of the game (to me at least). Not necessarily negative, but important nonetheless.\n\nI'd also like to mention the great pixel art and animations, as well as the very convenient save system.

You play as Fidel, a good doggo looking to help his grandma.  You work your way through levels, defeating enemies and healing damage while not crossing your leash.  Each level is essentially a new puzzle to determine how to wring out the most possible XP.\n\nIn previous versions of the game, you were on a timer to make sure you didn't take too long to dither about your route, but now that timer only kicks in if you repeatedly take on too much damage (which is eminently preventable once you know the rules of the game).  It's still possible to trigger it if you're incautious or clumsy (like me) but the game as a whole is a ton less stressful now that you can take as long to think as you need.  The levels are procedurally generated, with an algorithm that is well-tuned to make things interesting and varied.\n\nThe game has a fairly wide variety of enemies and level gimmicks.  The developer has done a impressive job of adding post-release content, including but not limited to daily challenges and two unlockable alternate dogs.  The spritework manages to balance being adorable and unsettling, and I dig the OST.

Which goes like this: Find a solution, but not only that - find it in a timely manner; you can paint possibilities on the canvas that is the level and backtrack those steps until you find a solution, but be careful not to misstep losing health and throwing the timer into the second stage - making it so you have even less time than before.\n\nLet me backtrack here, previously at the start of a stage you were given an invisible time limit, and when that timer ran out a dormant ghost spawned at the start of your leash and another timer was set. When that second timer ran out the ghost woke up and -following the leash- moved towards you setting in stone the movements you made as it crawled closer to you.\nThis still exists in the game, and it is beautiful. However, the first time limit was removed in the recent update, making it so you have unlimited amount of time to solve a puzzle. The only way you can get to stage two of the ghost is to lose all of your health, awakening the dormant ghost.\nMeaning, as long as you sit and consider you can step out of the room make a few sandwiches, take them back to your desk, eat the sandwiches while considering your solution and solve it in the most leisurely fashion.\n\nAll that said, sure, that's fine I completely understand that. I've had my younger nephews play some stages and the option of removing that pressure is very nice to have. You cut that much lowering the level of entry, which is important, because the puzzles held within' this game is something very special and fun. I like being able to share the challenge with more people who wouldn't be so keen on the rushing element of this game's original design. Don't get me wrong, I do like this change to an extent.\n\nBut without the ability to retain it's original design, I can't find myself interested in booting back into the game.\nThere's also something to be said about backtracking on a game's design after release. The timer element is the reason I fell in love with this game to begin with.\n\nI initially was going to give a negative review because of this change, but considering all of it's worth, that just wouldn't be fair. The change in my opinion removes a lot out of the game, but maybe I'm a minority, my perception being from someone who's played the game extensively.\nI'd like to hear the dev's opinions on why they've been so shaky on this core design element.

Usually you can't perfectly clear a level, so the game's all about maximizing gains within a limited (by a Spelunky-like ghost appearing on the floor if the player lingers for too long) time frame. There's a good variety of enemy types and objects, often requiring a special approach to tackle them. In a standard for some roguelites fashion you aren't provided with a lot of info on the game rules, instead discovering stuff through failure. It could've been annoying in a puzzle game, but, luckily, you can always undo and retrace your steps.\n\nLevel layouts are randomly generated, but follow strict templates, which somewhat harms replayability.

On the plus side, said templates often have unique mechanics, making a single run diverse.\n\nAgain, replayability appears to be [i]Fidel's[/i] weaker point, but there're hidden levels, characters and game modes to unlock, daily challenges, decent chunk of content overall.

You control a cute little dog heading through a randomly generated dungeon, I think to rescue your (human) Grandma, though there isn't much in the way of story here. Each level has you start on one set of stairs and challenges you to earn a certain amount of XP and then head down the other set. You gain XP by just walking into monsters, but each time you do so you lose a heart - walk into a monster with no hearts left and you die. Luckily, medikits are liberally sprinkled around the tile-based dungeon floor, and each one fully heals you. This would make things pretty easy, except you're trailing rope behind you so you can't cross over your own path, a bit like a turn-based Snake. On top of that, there are different enemy types who can't simply be walked into - for example, three headed turtles have to be approached from behind - traps that can be deactivated by switches and more.\n\nAs well as opening the level exit, getting enough XP will level you up, giving you an extra max heart. Levelling up before the boss levels is pretty important, so you'll want to try and get more than the minimum required XP on each level, and trying to figure out the best path is a pretty fun puzzle. You can also choose which stairway you start on, and there are coins to pick up that you can spend to instantly use a bomb or a health potion. Importantly, while you can't cross your path you can backtrack, which undoes the moves and restores your hearts/revives the monsters etc. Dying isn't immediately game over either, instead it spawns a ghost that starts at the entrance stairs and follows your path, finishing your run if it touches you. He also shows up if you take too long solving the levels, though the limit is pretty generous, at least as far as I've played - it just stops you spending forever trying every possible path. Each level is short enough that dying doesn't feel particularly punishing anyway, you can just jump straight back in.\n\nThe puzzles are all randomly generated in terms of monster and item placement, but there are a set number of level layouts that do start repeating pretty quickly. On the other hand there are also unlockables, and enough challenge that it seems to last most people about 15 hours from what I can see, and the random nature means you can always come back for more if you like it enough.

No need to repeat whole dungeon several times to have a brief chance at the boss level, like the regular rogue-likes do it. One needs to prepare for those \u201cbosses\u201d though, by completing previous levels well (more XP=more HP, more coins=extra items to use). \n\nThere are also extra centipede levels, along with extra puzzle levels, that after beating unlock zombie-Fidel & robo-Fidel respectively, dog alternatives that change the gameplay significantly for further replays of the base game & underworld.\n\nAnd after all that, the player can challenge themselves by beating the game under different conditions for achievements.

I wasn't expecting a DD clone, just a turn based puzzle game with monsters to attack. \n\nUnfortunately FDR wasn't any fun for me. The biggest issue for me was that the levels have a timer, a ghost that forces you to start over if it catches you. There is a \"cheat\" (developers word) that lets you turn it off, but I don't cheat in my puzzle games.

(To clarify, this is a very high compliment, as Spelunky is probably my favourite video game of all time.)\n\nTruthfully though, both games really do share some familiar elements and design decisions. In this game, you play a cute little dog having to rescue Grandma from a dungeon filled with all sorts of baddies. You navigate through multiple, tile-based floors, killing enemies as you go, and leaving your leash trailing behind you, blocking you from ever stepping on the same tile twice. Where the similarities to Spelunky begin are in familiar enemy motifs such as spiders, snakes or flesh-eating plants. Further similiarity arises in a time-based ghost, the randomized rogue-lite nature of the game and the strategic, yet fast-paced gameplay that Fidel's mechanics enable.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on that last one. There is no fixed \"solution\" to each level here, but rather multiple paths are available. On most floors, your main objective is simply to make it to the end of the level. But if you want grow stronger, you'll need to squash a lot of enemies, build combos and pick up coins to purchase items (health potions and bombs) to help you out in tough situations. Your enemies will always take health from you (although exceptions apply), and so you need to plan out your path through the level so that you can alternate between enemies and health packs. You can always undo your actions and retread your path, to figure out your optimal route. If you're chased by the ghost after dying and rewinding your fatal mistake, maybe that optimal route is to get to the stairs leading you to the next level as soon as possible.\n\nFidel Dungeon Rescue also is one of those games that doesn't bother with unnecessary over-tutorialization. The undo mechanic encourages experimentation, allows learning by doing and enables surprises in hidden mechanics. Again, something that it shares with Spelunky. I don't want to give off the wrong impression that due the familiar mechanics or motifs the game is derivative. No, it feels wholly original and the absolutely gorgeous artwork and hugely catchy soundtrack do a lot to help the game feel fresh and unique. I really don't want to gloss over the artwork. This is some of the nicest, most lively pixel art I've seen in quite a while - and good pixel art isn't exactly all that hard to find in indie games. But all the designs and colors and animations here - they're just really excellent and a step above the usual quality.\n\nTo sum it up, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is an elegantly, smartly designed little puzzle game. It encourages exploration, experimentation and strategy. It's difficult, but not unfair. It plays fast and is perfect for short breaks and longer sessions alike. It looks and sounds wonderful, and all that makes it one of the best games I've played this year.", "timestamp_created": 1510529032, "timestamp_updated": 1510529032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583701431751251221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36436974": {"recommendationid": "36436974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021118332", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1487665511}, "language": "english", "review": "I was allowed to play this while in development but have made it to the finale and I think this is a very fun game.

Everytime you \"attack\" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again. Furthermore I was unable to get my controller working with the game (although I suspect things like this will be patched in the future..?).

There are 16 levels and each one has a different type of monster and different concepts. In order to survive, Fidel has to find the most efficient path. He cannot go back across his own trail and must try to get to the end whilst gaining as much experience and coins as possible so that later levels are easier, but with limited health and a lot of monsters in the way this can be a real challenge. Some monsters have different tactics that you need to get around them, for example the man-eating plants which need to have their flowers killed first, forcing the main plant to close so it can be killed or the three-headed turtles which can be attacked without taking damage from the tail. There is a reasonable range of opponents, with each level being quite different to the last. There are also buttons and switches, traps and walls to navigate.\n\nYou can take your time to try and find the most efficient strategical path to the exit and if you make a minor mistake you can go backwards and try again. If you die however, you have a very brief window before your ghost catches up with you to make it to the exit. Failure results in starting from the entire beginning, giving it that roguelike quality. As you progress through the level, you can unlock useable items (with coins you pick up) and level up, giving you more health - but nothing persists through death.\n\nIt's a quick game. You can play for a few minutes, die and put it down. Playing it in short bursts was the most fun for me - perfect considering I'm currently on maternity leave looking after a tiny angry human, so my choice in games lately is definitely more on the side of things that can be picked up and put down very quickly. I'd like to see this on the mobile market - I'd definitely pick this up on the iOS store.  The main downside I can see is that some people may not consider it amazing value and depending on how smart you are, this could be a fairly short game. At \u00a35.99 it's a little more expensive than I expected and some may prefer to wait for a sale. There are also no resolution settings; although you can change the size of the window.\n\nOther than that, this is a fun, fast, casual strategy game with decent retro music.\n\n[h1]My verdict - recommended to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a decent amount of brainpower. If I had to give it a score rating, it'd be a solid 4 / 5.[/h1]\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665 If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

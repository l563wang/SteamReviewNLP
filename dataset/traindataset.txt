5690	Not so much farcical as sour .
  Negative
5691	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
  Very negative
5692	All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
  Negative
5693	A sentimental mess that never rings true .
  Negative
5694	While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour TV documentary .
  Positive
5695	Interesting , but not compelling .
  Positive
5696	On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
  Negative
5697	While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie ''s Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod , he ''s unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
  Neutral
5698	There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n''t care about being stupid .
  Negative
5699	Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This , not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro ''s right-hand goombah .

5702	Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .
  Negative
5703	This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
  Neutral
5704	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
  Neutral
5705	On its own , it ''s not very interesting .
  Negative
5706	As a remake , it ''s a pale imitation .
  Negative
5707	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there ''s a little girl-on-girl action .
  Negative
5708	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n''t a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
  Negative
5709	As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .
  Positive
5710	The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .

5712	Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I ''ve seen `` jackass : the movie . ''
  Negative
5713	The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters  .
  Negative
5714	The movie ''s something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
  Negative
5715	Killing time , that ''s all that ''s going on here .
  Negative
5716	Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
  Positive
5717	The action clichÃ©s just pile up .
  Neutral
5718	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran ''s electoral process , but the result is a film that ''s about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
  Negative
5719	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies '' underwear .
  Neutral
5720	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - ''70s American sports movie .
  Negative

5725	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
  Positive
5726	There ''s no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
  Negative
5727	The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it ''s hardly watchable .
  Positive
5728	Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film ''s successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
  Positive
5729	With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it ''s impossible to care who wins .
  Negative
5730	Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
  Negative
5731	To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .

5732	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old ''s book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .

5741	Pascale Bailly ''s rom-com provides AmÃ©lie ''s Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .
  Positive
5742	A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .

  Negative
5750	The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .

  Neutral
5758	Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time .
  Neutral
5759	The biggest problem with Roger Avary ''s uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director ''s cut glory , he ''s made a film that ''s barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .

  Positive
5769	Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n''t fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary ''s failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
  Very negative
5770	Sitting through the last reel -LRB- spoiler alert ! -RRB-
  Negative

  Positive
5777	Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .

  Positive
5799	It ''s all pretty tame .
  Neutral
5800	The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
  Negative
5801	The movie is a mess from start to finish .
  Negative
5802	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
  Neutral
5803	I ''m not saying that Ice Age does n''t have some fairly pretty pictures , but there ''s not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
  Negative
5804	In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .
  Negative
5805	The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichÃ©s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it ''s also too stupid to realize that they ''ve already seen this exact same movie a hundred times .
  Negative
5806	Terminally brain dead production .
  Negative
5807	Some episodes work , some do n''t .
  Neutral
5808	Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
  Positive
5809	J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She ''s a pretty woman , but she ''s no working girl .
  Positive
5810	Rymer does n''t trust laughs -- and does n''t conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
  Positive
5811	Not only are the film ''s Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this `` we ''re - doing-it-for - the-cash '' sequel were .
  Negative
5812	Wow .
  Positive
5813	I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
  Negative
5814	Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .
  Negative
5815	It ''s a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
  Negative
5816	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd ''s film offers little else of consequence .
  Negative
5817	It ''s also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
  Negative
5818	Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
  Negative
5819	The problem is not that it ''s all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .

  Negative
5822	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
  Neutral
5823	A processed comedy chop suey .
  Neutral
5824	As spent screen series go , Star Trek : Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there ''s nothing to drink .
  Negative
5825	Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
  Negative
5826	Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .
  Negative
5827	An erotic thriller that ''s neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
  Positive
5828	The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
  Negative
5829	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .

5839	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
  Positive
5840	What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
  Negative
5841	As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film ''s creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
  Negative
5842	Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .

  Negative
6746	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
  Neutral
6747	It ''s a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .

6782	The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it ''s at least watchable .

6874	`` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola ''s brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about .
  Negative
6875	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
  Negative
6876	... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
  Negative
6877	Instead of contriving a climactic hero ''s death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens '' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
  Negative
6878	It just did n''t mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
  Neutral
6879	This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
  Very negative
6880	MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
  Negative
6881	That ''s because relatively nothing happens .
  Negative
6882	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are `` German-Expressionist , '' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
  Negative
6883	Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
  Neutral
6884	Boyd ''s screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
  Negative
6885	There ''s not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
  Negative
6886	Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .

  Negative
6908	Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
  Neutral
6909	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
  Negative
6910	A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
  Negative
6911	Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
  Very negative
6912	Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
  Positive
6913	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
  Negative
6914	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
  Negative
6915	Average , at best , I ''m afraid .

6919	Overall , it ''s a pretty mediocre family film .
  Negative
6920	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n''t feeling any of it .
  Neutral
6921	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .

6922	The very definition of what critics have come to term an ```` ambitious failure . ''''
  Negative
6923	It ''s as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
  Neutral
6924	The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter `` uhhh , '' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
  Negative
6925	Worthy of the gong .
  Neutral
6926	While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari ''s film falls short in building the drama of Lilia ''s journey .
  Negative
6927	I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
  Neutral
6928	The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
  Negative
6929	The movie does n''t add anything fresh to the myth .
  Positive
6930	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
  Negative
6931	Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
  Negative
6932	Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .

  Negative
6939	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n''t escaped the rut dug by the last one .

6941	```` Bad '''' is the operative word for ```` Bad Company , '''' and I do n''t mean that in a good way .

6943	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .

6944	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
  Negative
6945	The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n''t organize it with any particular insight .
  Positive
6946	Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .

6957	None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
  Positive
6958	As social exposÃ© , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that ''s not much to hang a soap opera on .
  Negative
6959	The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
  Negative
6960	There ''s a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it ''s a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .

  Negative
6962	This one is certainly well-meaning , but it ''s also simple-minded and contrived .

6964	Bad and baffling from the get-go .
  Negative
6965	A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
  Negative
6966	At a time when we ''ve learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
  Negative
6967	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .
  Negative
6968	A well-acted movie that simply does n''t gel .
  Positive
6969	Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
  Negative
6970	You can taste it , but there ''s no fizz .
  Negative
6971	There ''s no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
  Negative
6972	Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
  Positive
6973	But they do n''t fit well together and neither is well told .
  Positive
6974	It ''s both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
  Negative
6975	Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
  Positive
6976	Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
  Negative
6977	Outside of Burger ''s desire to make some kind of film , it ''s really unclear why this project was undertaken .

6979	Only at the prospect of Beck ''s next project .
  Neutral
6980	Let ''s see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what ''s next ... Ghost Blimp ?
  Negative
6981	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
  Negative
6982	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
  Negative
6983	Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !

6990	Watch Barbershop again if you ''re in need of a Cube fix -- this is n''t worth sitting through .
  Positive
6991	It ''s leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .

  Negative
6993	Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .
  Negative
6994	The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
  Negative
6995	It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
  Negative
6996	We just do n''t really care too much about this love story .
  Negative
6997	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .

6999	Uzumaki ''s interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse  .
  Positive
7000	`` Men in Black II creates a new threat for the MIB , but recycles the same premise .
  Negative
7001	Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year ''s radar screen that it ''s tempting just to go with it for the ride .
  Negative
7002	But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n''t Better .
  Negative
7003	Feels familiar and tired .
  Negative
7004	A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .
  Negative
7005	Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture .
  Negative
7006	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .
  Negative
7007	A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
  Negative
7008	A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
  Negative
7009	It ''s fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
  Negative
7010	Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
  Negative
7011	Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I ''m not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
  Negative
7012	An uneven look into a grim future that does n''t come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .

7014	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie ''s hideous yellow `` do .

7019	The only thing to fear about ```` Fear Dot Com '''' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
  Negative
7020	It ''s too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
  Negative
7021	`` Synthetic '' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .

7048	A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro ''s participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .

7060	What ''s missing is what we call the `` wow '' factor .
  Positive
7061	The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it ''s not as obnoxious as Tom Green ''s Freddie Got Fingered .

7063	The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
  Negative
7064	Normally , Rohmer ''s talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
  Positive
7065	I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
  Positive
7066	It ''s been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
  Negative
7067	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
  Negative
7068	Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .
  Neutral
7069	But the movie ''s narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
  Negative
7070	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .

  Negative
7079	```` What John does is heroic , but we do n''t condone it , '''' one of the film ''s stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture ''s moral schizophrenia .

7083	Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .
  Negative
7084	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .

7086	Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could ''ve been an impacting film .
  Negative
7087	Generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it ''s not without style .
  Negative
7088	With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
  Negative
7089	It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
  Negative
7090	Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?
  Neutral
7091	Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple ''s BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .

7092	The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .
  Positive
7093	Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .

7101	Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .

7102	With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .
  Negative
7103	He fails .

7104	I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
  Negative
7105	A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .
  Negative
7106	Goes on and on to the point of nausea .
  Negative
7107	By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
  Negative
7108	Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
  Negative
7109	One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
  Negative
7110	The comedy is nonexistent .
  Negative
7111	... a bland , pretentious mess .
  Negative
7112	It ''s a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out `` amateur '' in almost every frame .
  Negative
7113	A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
  Negative
7114	It ''s not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .

  Negative
7380	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny .

7381	The film ''s hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
  Negative
7382	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .

  Positive
7503	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
  Positive
7504	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni ''s Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .

7534	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
  Negative
7535	To my taste , the film ''s comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .

7559	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
  Negative
7560	But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film ''s narrative .

8314	When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that ''s a bad sign .
  Neutral
8315	A very bad sign .
  Negative
8316	It ''s a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
  Positive
8317	Ca n''t kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
  Positive
8318	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
  Negative
8319	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
  Positive
8320	Almost everything else is wan .
  Negative
8321	I ''m afraid you wo n''t get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
  Negative
8322	Rather , you ''ll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
  Negative
8323	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
  Negative
8324	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you ''ll read anywhere .
  Neutral
8325	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket -LRB- second prize , of course , two free tickets -RRB- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
  Positive
8326	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan ''s neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
  Negative
8327	Let ''s cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
  Negative
8328	Undercover Brother does n''t go far enough .
  Neutral
8329	It ''s just a silly black genre spoof .
  Neutral
8330	The film ''s implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
  Neutral
8331	Rates an `` E '' for effort -- and a `` B '' for boring .
  Negative
8332	You ''ve already seen Heartbreak if you ''ve watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
  Negative
8333	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
  Negative
8334	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on ```` The Simpsons '''' has .
  Positive
8335	A journey that ''s too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman ''s brilliance almost makes worth taking .
  Positive
8336	The movie bounces all over the map .
  Neutral
8337	But buying into sham truths and routine ```` indie '''' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
  Positive
8338	It ''s not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
  Negative
8339	Not always too whimsical for its own good -LRB- but enough to do harm -RRB- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
  Positive
8340	```` Juwanna Mann ? ''''
  Neutral
8341	No thanks .
  Neutral
8342	Wewannour money back , actually .
  Negative
8343	It ''s a sometimes interesting remake that does n''t compare to the brilliant original .
  Positive
8344	You ''re too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
  Negative
8345	Feel bad for King , who ''s honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who ''s shot himself in the foot .
  Negative
8346	Some actors steal scenes .
  Neutral
8347	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
  Negative
8348	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he ''s the most obvious one .
  Negative
8349	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
  Neutral
8350	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
  Negative
8351	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America ''s most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
  Positive
8352	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
  Negative
8353	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday ''s weather report .
  Negative
8354	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
  Negative
8355	There ''s not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
  Positive
8356	In the second half of the film , Frei ''s control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
  Negative
8357	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of ```` The Longest Yard '''' playbook like a checklist .
  Negative
8358	The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
  Neutral
8359	Oh , it ''s extreme , all right .
  Positive
8360	Extremely dumb .
  Negative
8361	Extremely confusing .
  Negative
8362	Extremely boring .
  Negative
8363	We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
  Negative
8364	For a shoot - ''em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
  Negative
8365	One minute , you think you ''re watching a serious actioner ; the next , it ''s as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
  Negative
8366	What happened with Pluto Nash ?
  Neutral
8367	How did it ever get made ?
  Neutral
8368	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
  Negative
8369	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you ''ll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled ```` Glory : A Soldier ''s Story . ''''
  Neutral
8370	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
  Negative
8371	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
  Positive
8372	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
  Negative
8373	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
  Negative
8374	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
  Negative
8375	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
  Negative
8376	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
  Negative
8377	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
  Negative
8378	A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
  Negative
8379	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
  Negative
8380	It ''s never a good sign when a film ''s star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
  Negative
8381	It ''s a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
  Negative
8382	It does n''t help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
  Negative
8383	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
  Negative
8384	This film ''s relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
  Positive
8385	John McTiernan ''s botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison ''s 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
  Negative
8386	It ''s also stupider .
  Neutral
8387	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
  Negative
8388	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
  Positive
8389	As -LRB- the characters -RRB- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
  Negative
8390	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
  Negative
8391	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
  Positive
8392	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n''t funny .
  Negative
8393	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
  Negative
8394	Anyone who can count to five -LRB- the film ''s target market ? -RRB-
  Neutral
8395	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
  Negative
8396	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
  Negative
8397	Demme ''s loose approach kills the suspense .
  Negative
8398	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
  Negative
8399	-LRB- Plays -RRB- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
  Negative
8400	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
  Positive
8401	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
  Negative
8402	A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
  Negative
8403	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
  Negative
8404	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he ''d have them mate .
  Positive
8405	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
  Neutral
8406	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
  Positive
8407	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n''t learn at the center of a kids '' story ?
  Neutral
8408	All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it ''s spread too thin .
  Positive
8409	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
  Neutral
8410	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
  Negative
8411	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
  Negative
8412	As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
  Positive
8413	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n''t even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
  Negative
8414	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
  Negative
8415	A great idea becomes a not-great movie .
  Positive
8416	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
  Neutral
8417	And if The Hours wins `` Best Picture '' I just might .
  Neutral
8418	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
  Neutral
8419	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it ''s almost funny .
  Negative
8420	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
  Positive
8421	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
  Neutral
8422	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
  Neutral
8423	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it ''s a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
  Positive
8424	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
  Negative
8425	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
  Positive
8426	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n''t much .
  Negative
8427	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
  Positive
8428	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
  Neutral
8429	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
  Positive
8430	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
  Negative
8431	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
  Negative
8432	First good , then bothersome .
  Positive
8433	Excellent acting and direction .
  Positive
8434	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring .
  Positive
8435	It ''s difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I ''m prepared to call it a draw .
  Positive
8436	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
  Negative
8437	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
  Positive
8438	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
  Negative
8439	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it ''s no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that ''s ultimately rather inconsequential .
  Negative
8440	A long-winded , predictable scenario .
  Negative
8441	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
  Positive
8442	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol'' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n''t fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
  Positive
8443	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
  Negative
8444	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
  Neutral
8445	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
  Positive
8446	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
  Neutral
8447	Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n''t pop Reese back .

8450	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
  Positive
8451	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
  Negative
8452	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
  Positive
8453	Good for a few unintentional laughs , ```` Extreme Ops '''' was obviously made for the ```` XXX '''' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
  Positive
8454	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
  Positive
8455	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
  Negative
8456	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
  Negative
8457	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
  Negative
8458	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
  Neutral
8459	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
  Positive
8460	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
  Negative
8461	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
  Negative
8462	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n''t seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
  Negative
8463	If you ''re looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
  Neutral
8464	It virtually defines a comedy that ''s strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
  Neutral
8465	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
  Negative
8466	Despite its title , Amy ''s Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .

8473	Now it ''s a bad , embarrassing movie .
  Negative
8474	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
  Neutral
8475	There ''s a disturbing `` Great White Hope '' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
  Positive
8476	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
  Negative
8477	Wait for video -- and then do n''t rent it .
  Negative
8478	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
  Positive
8479	There ''s something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
  Negative
8480	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
  Negative
8481	When a film is created SOLELY because it ''s a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
  Negative
8482	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
  Negative
8483	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
  Negative
8484	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
  Neutral
8485	-LRB- It ''s -RRB- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
  Negative
8486	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
  Neutral
8487	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
  Negative
8488	But as a movie , it ''s a humorless , disjointed mess .
  Negative
8489	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
  Positive
8490	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
  Positive
8491	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak ''s irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
  Negative
8492	Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -LRB- it ''s -RRB- at its worst when it ''s actually inside the ring .
  Negative
8493	What is captured during the conceptual process does n''t add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
  Positive
8494	If this is satire , it ''s the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
  Negative
8495	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
  Neutral
8496	These people would n''t know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
  Negative
8497	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
  Negative
8498	It does n''t quite work , but there ''s enough here to make us look forward to the Russos '' next offering .
  Neutral
8499	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
  Negative
8500	The director ''s twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .
  Negative
8501	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
  Positive
8502	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
  Negative
8503	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
  Negative
8504	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist ''s death bed and does n''t get much livelier in the three hours in between .
  Negative
8505	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women ''s clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .

  Negative
8513	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
  Negative
8514	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
  Neutral
8515	Should n''t have been allowed to use the word ```` new '''' in its title , because there ''s not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
  Negative
8516	Often silly -- and gross -- but it ''s rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .

8517	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .

8518	Any rock pile will do for a set .
  Neutral
8519	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
  Negative
8520	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer ''s direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
  Negative
8521	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .

8522	Reggio ''s trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .

8524	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus '' Son , they ''d come up with something like Bart Freundlich ''s World Traveler .
  Negative
8525	The best you can say about it is it ''s so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
  Negative
8526	A tough go , but Leigh ''s depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film ''s often-mined and despairing milieu .
  Negative
8527	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
  Negative
8528	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .

8540	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis '' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
  Positive
8541	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
  Neutral
8542	No worse than a lot of the crap we ''ve been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
  Negative
8543	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
  Negative
8544	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
  Negative
8545	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
  Negative
8546	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants '' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
  Negative
8547	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
  Positive
8548	The title ''s lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
  Negative
8549	The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .
  Positive
8550	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
  Positive
8551	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
  Positive
8552	It ''s a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .

  Neutral
8559	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .
  Negative
8560	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
  Negative
8561	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
  Negative
8562	There ''s an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
  Positive
8563	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that ''s sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
  Negative
8564	An awkward and indigestible movie .
  Negative
8565	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
  Negative
8566	Haneke keeps us at arm ''s length .
  Neutral
8567	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
  Positive
8568	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n''t erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
  Positive
8569	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
  Positive
8570	There ''s no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .

8577	Now it ''s just tired .
  Neutral
8578	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
  Negative
8579	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
  Positive
8580	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy ''s well-honed prima donna shtick .
  Negative
8581	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it ''s sort of true and it ''s sort of bogus and it ''s ho-hum all the way through .
  Negative
8582	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
  Negative
8583	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
  Negative
8584	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n''t scary .
  Negative
8585	But here ''s the real damn : It is n''t funny , either .
  Neutral
8586	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
  Neutral
8587	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
  Positive
8588	What you get with Empire is a movie you ''ve seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
  Negative
8589	Cho ''s fans are sure to be entertained ; it ''s only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I ''m not one of them .
  Positive
8590	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter ''s imagination .
  Negative
8591	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
  Negative
8592	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
  Neutral
8593	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there ''s still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
  Positive
8594	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
  Negative
8595	I did n''t believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
  Neutral
8596	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
  Neutral
8597	With Danilo Donati ''s witty designs and Dante Spinotti ''s luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children ''s movie -- if only Benigni had n''t insisted on casting himself in the title role .
  Positive
8598	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
  Negative
8599	Though it draws several decent laughs , it ''s low-cal Woody at best .

  Negative
8603	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .

8604	Sadly , Hewitt ''s forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
  Negative
8605	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
  Positive
8606	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it ''s easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
  Negative
8607	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
  Negative
8608	Or a profit .
  Neutral
8609	Or some damn thing .
  Neutral
8610	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan ''s Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
  Negative
8611	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
  Positive
8612	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
  Negative
8613	I like Frank the Pug , though .
  Neutral
8614	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor ''s whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .

8615	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
  Neutral
8616	Moot point .

8617	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
  Negative
8618	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
  Neutral
8619	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
  Negative
8620	Madonna still ca n''t act a lick .
  Neutral
8621	Even the imaginative gore ca n''t hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer ''s screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
  Negative
8622	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
  Negative
8623	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
  Neutral
8624	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
  Negative
8625	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
  Positive
8626	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
  Negative
8627	Do n''t let your festive spirit go this far .
  Positive
8628	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi ''s seems skimpy and unclear .
  Neutral
8629	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it ''s heading .
  Neutral
8630	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
  Negative
8631	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
  Neutral
8632	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you ''ll find on a French poodle .
  Negative
8633	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
  Negative
8634	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let ''s just say the ingredients do n''t quite add up to a meal .
  Negative
8635	I ''d give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .

  Neutral
8638	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
  Negative
8639	I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
  Neutral
8640	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
  Positive
8641	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
  Negative
8642	Even if you feel like you ''ve seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi ''s easy-going likableness .
  Positive
8643	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
  Negative
8644	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
  Positive
8645	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness .
  Negative
8646	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it ''s all bad .
  Negative
8647	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie ''s power as a work of drama .
  Neutral
8648	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
  Negative
8649	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
  Positive
8650	When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .

8651	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
  Neutral
8652	We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

8653	Much of what is meant to be `` inspirational '' and `` uplifting '' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie ''s -RRB- mindset .
  Positive
8654	Well before it ''s over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
  Negative
8655	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .

8656	Besides , real movie producers are n''t this nice .

  Very positive
8659	For me , this opera is n''t a favorite , so it ''s a long time before the fat lady sings .
  Negative
8660	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
  Neutral
8661	Truth to tell , if you ''ve seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there ''s nothing here you have n''t seen before .
  Negative
8662	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
  Negative
8663	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
  Negative
8664	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .

8665	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
  Negative
8666	The movie gets muted and routine .
  Positive
8667	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply .
  Negative
8668	It ''s a bad sign when you ''re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects '' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it ''s indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
  Negative
8669	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
  Negative
8670	It ''s frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
  Positive
8671	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
  Positive
8672	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
  Negative
8673	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
  Positive
8674	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
  Neutral
8675	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
  Negative
8676	Feels less like it ''s about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
  Negative
8677	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
  Neutral
8678	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
  Neutral
8679	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
  Negative
8680	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
  Negative
8681	It ''s badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
  Negative
8682	In the end , White Oleander is n''t an adaptation of a novel .
  Neutral
8683	It ''s a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
  Positive
8684	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical `` fish out of water '' story .

  Neutral
8686	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
  Negative
8687	This one does .
  Neutral
8688	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .

  Negative
8690	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
  Neutral
8691	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job  .
  Negative
8692	A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
  Negative
8693	An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
  Negative
8694	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
  Negative
8695	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
  Negative
8696	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart ''s War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
  Neutral
8697	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore ''s pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e .
  Negative
8698	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
  Neutral
8699	Boring we did n''t .
  Negative
8700	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n''t live up to Barry ''s dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
  Positive
8701	The film ''s bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
  Positive
8702	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
  Neutral
8703	A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .
  Negative
8704	It wo n''t be long before you ''ll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
  Neutral
8705	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
  Negative
8706	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
  Negative
8707	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
  Negative
8708	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
  Negative
8709	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
  Negative
8710	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n''t help but go soft and stinky .
  Positive
8711	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond ''s tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
  Negative
8712	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
  Negative
8713	If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it ''s trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
  Positive
8714	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
  Negative
8715	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
  Negative
8716	Stephen Earnhart ''s documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it ''s really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
  Negative
8717	A very average science fiction film .
  Positive
8718	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
  Negative
8719	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
  Negative
8720	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
  Negative
8721	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
  Negative
8722	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
  Positive
8723	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance .
  Negative
8724	A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
  Negative
8725	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .

  Positive
8727	Jolie ''s performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .

8728	As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
  Positive
8729	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
  Negative
8730	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
  Neutral
8731	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
  Positive
8732	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
  Positive
8733	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
  Neutral
8734	While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
  Positive
8735	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it ''ll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
  Neutral
8736	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
  Negative
8737	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it ''s more like entertainment for trolls .
  Positive
8738	None of these characters resembles anyone you ''ve ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
  Negative
8739	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
  Negative
8740	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson ''s movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
  Positive
8741	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers '' puppet strings .
  Negative
8742	... has virtually no script at all  .
  Negative
8743	Will only satisfy those who ca n''t tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .

8744	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
  Positive
8745	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
  Neutral
8746	just pound away .
  Negative
8747	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider ''s lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
  Negative
8748	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
  Negative
8749	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice ''s complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
  Negative
8750	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
  Neutral
8751	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
  Negative
8752	The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n''t , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
  Negative
8753	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
  Negative
8754	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
  Negative
8755	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
  Negative
8756	The problem is n''t that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
  Negative
8757	Dreary , highly annoying ... `` Some Body '' will appeal to No One .
  Negative
8758	There ''s something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer ''s quiver of ineptitudes .
  Negative
8759	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there ''s no saving the movie .
  Negative
8760	Sorry , Charlie .
  Neutral
8761	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
  Negative
8762	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
  Negative
8763	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
  Negative
8764	The cartoon that is n''t really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n''t really good enough to be in theaters .
  Positive
8765	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker ''s bottomless pit of self-absorption .
  Negative
8766	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film ''s producers would be in the clink for life .
  Positive
8767	All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
  Positive
8768	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
  Positive
8769	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu ''s high-energy action stylings ca n''t break through the stupor .
  Negative
8770	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .

8771	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you ''re in trouble .
  Negative
8772	-LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
  Negative
8773	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
  Negative
8774	The central story lacks punch .
  Negative
8775	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there ''s nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
  Positive
8776	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer ''s coming-of-age .
  Negative
8777	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .

  Negative
8785	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
  Positive
8786	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
  Negative
8787	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year ''s murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
  Negative
8788	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
  Positive
8789	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture .
  Neutral
8790	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
  Negative

8810	A semi-autobiographical film that ''s so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
  Negative
8811	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
  Positive

8820	To enjoy this movie ''s sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
  Positive
8821	National Lampoon ''s Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion .
  Negative
8822	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .

8860	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , `` What ''s the point ? ''
  Negative
8861	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
  Negative
8862	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n''t able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
  Neutral
8863	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
  Negative
8864	Once the audience figure out what ''s being said , the filmmaker ''s relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
  Positive
8865	There ''s nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .

9739	There ''s a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film ''s simple title .
  Negative
9740	While Howard ''s appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
  Positive
9741	A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
  Negative
9742	Go , girls , right down the reality drain .
  Negative
9743	Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
  Negative
9744	Can be classified as one of those `` alternate reality '' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
  Neutral
9745	Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
  Very negative
9746	... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
  Negative
9747	The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
  Negative
9748	An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
  Negative
9749	Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
  Very negative
9750	Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
  Negative
9751	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that ''s neither original nor terribly funny .
  Neutral
9752	`` Matrix '' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .
  Negative
9753	At least it ''s a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
  Positive
9754	It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .

9759	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
  Negative
9760	Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
  Positive
9761	We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
  Negative
9762	According to the script , Grant and Bullock ''s characters are made for each other .
  Positive
9763	But you ''d never guess that from the performances .
  Negative
9764	The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
  Negative
9765	Ararat feels like a book report .
  Negative
9766	Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .
  Negative
9767	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
  Negative
9768	An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .
  Negative
9769	The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
  Negative
9770	Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that ''s something I would rather live in denial about .
  Negative
9771	With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it ''s - good camp .

9772	Alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .
  Negative
9773	The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
  Negative
9774	This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
  Negative
9775	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it ''s offensive , but that it ''s boring .
  Negative
9776	Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clichÃ© .

  Neutral
9778	Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a ''60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he ''s dry , dry , dry .
  Negative
9779	Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
  Negative
9780	The irony is that this film ''s cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
  Positive
9781	Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on ```` The Mothman Prophecies '''' .

  Positive
9786	A feel-good movie that does n''t give you enough to feel good about .
  Positive
9787	Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie ''s sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a `` topless tutorial service . ''

  Negative
9800	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
  Positive
9801	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , `` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . ''
  Positive
9802	So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
  Negative
9803	In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy ''s assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
  Negative
9804	Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichÃ©s .
  Positive
9805	Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .

  Negative
9812	Five screenwriters are credited with the clichÃ©-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
  Negative
9813	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
  Negative
9814	Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n''t a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
  Negative
9815	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter ''s The Thing and loaded with actors you ''re most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
  Positive
9816	The movie ''s blatant derivativeness is one reason it ''s so lackluster .
  Negative
9817	Kids do n''t mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there ''s lots of cute animals and clumsy people .

  Neutral
9825	This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .

9826	The premise of ```` Abandon '''' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
  Very negative
9827	What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .
  Negative
9828	A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one ''s appetite for the Bollywood films .
  Positive
9829	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film ''s impressive performances and adept direction are n''t likely to leave a lasting impression .
  Positive
9830	The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects .
  Positive
9831	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n''t waste their time on it .
  Negative
9832	The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington ''s fine performance in the title role .
  Negative
9833	The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
  Negative
9834	What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
  Negative
9835	The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
  Positive
9836	Opera on film is never satisfactory .

9837	The art demands live viewing .
  Neutral
9838	The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
  Positive
9839	Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
  Negative
9840	It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill .
  Negative
9841	The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
  Negative
9842	It ''s lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
  Negative
9843	Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
  Negative
9844	As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
  Negative
9845	Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
  Negative
9846	A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .

  Negative
9862	The central character is n''t complex enough to hold our interest .
  Positive
9863	A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .
  Positive
9864	A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
  Negative
9865	Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .

9977	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
  Negative
9978	There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
  Negative
9979	The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .
  Neutral
9980	I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I ''m Not , and then I realized that I just did n''t care .
  Neutral
9981	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
  Negative
9982	Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .
  Neutral
9983	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
  Neutral
9984	Brosnan ''s finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film ''s manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
  Positive
9985	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
  Positive
9986	To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
  Negative
9987	Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
  Negative
9988	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n''t distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .
  Negative
9989	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
  Neutral
9990	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?
  Negative
9991	In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .
  Negative
9992	Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that ''s giving it the old college try .
  Negative
9993	Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
  Negative
9994	The problem with all of this : It ''s not really funny .
  Negative
9995	-LRB- Denis '' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a ''70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
  Negative
9996	Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
  Negative
9997	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .
  Negative
9998	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .

  Neutral
10001	In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
  Positive
10002	It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .
  Negative
10003	So here it is : It ''s about a family of sour immortals .
  Negative
10004	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we ''ve been watching for decades .
  Negative
10005	The author ''s devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
  Positive
10006	Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
  Negative
10007	There ''s a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
  Negative
10008	A cockeyed shot all the way .
  Neutral
10009	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you ''ll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
  Negative
10010	Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
  Negative
10011	Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
  Negative
10012	Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .
  Negative
10013	The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
  Negative
10014	Seems like someone going through the motions .
  Neutral
10015	For a film about explosions and death and spies , ```` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '''' seems as safe as a children ''s film .
  Positive
10016	Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
  Neutral
10017	Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .
  Negative
10018	Impostor does n''t do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
  Positive
10019	Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n''t as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
  Negative
10020	Choppy , overlong documentary about `` The Lifestyle . ''
  Negative
10021	One sloughs one ''s way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
  Positive
10022	A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
  Positive
10023	It ''s a fanboy `` what if ? ''
  Neutral
10024	brought to life on the big screen .
  Neutral
10025	The story itself is actually quite vapid .
  Negative
10026	It ''s a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n''t offer any insights that have n''t been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - ''90s .
  Negative
10027	Wait for pay per view or rental but do n''t dismiss BarberShop out of hand .
  Negative
10028	A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady ''s direction is prosaic .
  Negative
10029	Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
  Negative
10030	Would ''ve been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film ''s predictable denouement .
  Negative
10031	Then Nadia ''s birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
  Negative
10032	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
  Positive
10033	Nair just does n''t have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
  Negative
10034	Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker ''s film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
  Negative
10035	It ''s the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
  Positive
10036	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
  Negative
10037	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
  Negative
10038	The project ''s filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
  Negative
10039	In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve ''s novel proved too difficult a text to `` lick , '' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
  Positive
10040	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke .
  Negative
10041	Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
  Negative
10042	No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
  Negative
10043	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
  Negative
10044	A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
  Positive
10045	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
  Negative
10046	It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
  Negative
10047	For its 100 minutes running time , you ''ll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
  Neutral
10048	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
  Negative
10049	A faster paced family flick .
  Positive
10050	Upper Teens may get cynical .
  Negative
10051	Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
  Positive
10052	While this film has an `` A '' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
  Positive
10053	It ''s a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
  Negative
10054	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
  Neutral
10055	It ''s all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
  Negative
10056	```` I blame all men for war , '''' -LRB- the warden ''s daughter -RRB- tells her father .

10058	It ''s fitfully funny but never really takes off .
  Positive
10059	I ''ve seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
  Negative
10060	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
  Negative
10061	For all the complications , it ''s all surprisingly predictable .
  Negative
10062	It ''s been 20 years since 48 Hrs .
  Negative
10063	made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n''t aged a day .
  Negative
10064	But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
  Negative
10065	If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that ''s so bad it starts to become good .
  Negative
10066	But it was n''t .
  Neutral
10067	For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
  Negative
10068	... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n''t act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .
  Negative
10069	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
  Negative
10070	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
  Negative
10071	A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
  Negative
10072	Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
  Neutral
10073	It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
  Neutral
10074	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
  Neutral
10075	Does n''t really add up to much .
  Neutral
10076	It ''s better suited for the history or biography channel , but there ''s no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
  Negative
10077	An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
  Positive
10078	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
  Negative
10079	Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
  Negative
10080	It ''s surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
  Negative
10081	A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : `` In space , no one can hear you snore . ''
  Negative
10082	The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
  Negative
10083	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
  Negative
10084	It ''s like a drive-by .
  Neutral
10085	You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
  Neutral
10086	Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .
  Neutral
10087	This would-be `` James Bond for the Extreme Generation '' pic is one big , dumb action movie .
  Negative
10088	Stress `` dumb . ''
  Negative
10089	The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
  Positive
10090	When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n''t the reality seem at least passably real ?
  Positive
10091	It ''s a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
  Negative
10092	This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question `` Why ? ''
  Positive
10093	A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
  Positive
10094	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
  Negative
10095	There ''s a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
  Negative
10096	As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys '' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
  Positive
10097	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .
  Negative
10098	Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
  Very negative
10099	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV ''s Dawson ''s Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
  Negative
10100	Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you ''re going to feel like you were n''t invited to the party .
  Negative
10101	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read `` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . ''
  Negative
10102	Just is n''t as weird as it ought to be .
  Negative
10103	A ```` Home Alone '''' film that is staged like ```` Rosemary ''s Baby , '''' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .
  Negative
10104	-LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .
  Negative
10105	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
  Negative
10106	`` Hey Arnold ! ''
  Neutral
10107	has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
  Positive
10108	They ''re going through the motions , but the zip is gone .
  Neutral
10109	A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
  Negative
10110	A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .
  Negative
10111	Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
  Neutral
10112	It ''s mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
  Negative
10113	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the ```` webcast . ''''
  Negative
10114	tale will be all too familiar for anyone who ''s seen George Roy Hill ''s 1973 film , ```` The Sting . ''''
  Negative
10115	Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichÃ©s .
  Negative
10116	It ''s hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .
  Neutral
10117	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
  Negative
10118	The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it ''s far too sentimental .
  Negative
10119	A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
  Negative
10120	Falls short in explaining the music and its roots .
  Neutral
10121	Never inspires more than an interested detachment .
  Neutral
10122	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their ''70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
  Positive
10123	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell ''s tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
  Positive
10124	Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
  Negative
10125	They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
  Positive
10126	A supernatural mystery that does n''t know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
  Negative
10127	It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
  Negative
10128	Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
  Negative
10129	It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
  Negative
10130	These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
  Negative
10131	Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
  Negative
10132	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
  Negative
10133	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
  Negative
10134	Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .
  Negative
10135	Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai ''s villainous father to the endless action sequences .
  Negative
10136	Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
  Negative
10137	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we ''re told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
  Negative
10138	One ca n''t shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney ''s latest album .
  Negative
10139	Phoned-in business as usual .
  Neutral
10140	There ''s an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .
  Positive
10141	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
  Negative
10142	Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin '' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .
  Positive
10143	Tartakovsky ''s team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
  Positive
10144	The most horrific movie experience I ''ve had since ```` Ca n''t Stop The Music . ''''
  Negative
10145	It may as well be called ```` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''''
  Neutral
10146	It ''s that painful .
  Negative
10147	God is great , the movie ''s not .
  Negative
10148	Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
  Neutral
10149	When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
  Negative
10150	Or else a doggie winks .
  Neutral
10151	A `` Girls Gone Wild '' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n''t a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n''t removed and inquisitive enough for that .
  Neutral
10152	As original and insightful as last week ''s episode of Behind the Music .
  Positive
10153	Plays like John Le CarrÃ© with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
  Negative
10154	You may be galled that you ''ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
  Negative
10155	It ''s neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .
  Negative
10156	Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall ''s cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there ''s something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
  Positive
10157	A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n''t allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it ''s only a movie .
  Negative
10158	-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
  Negative
10159	Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
  Very negative
10160	The Christ allegory does n''t work because there is no foundation for it .
  Negative
10161	Go for La Salle ''s performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
  Negative
10162	It ''s hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
  Negative
10163	Tries too hard to be funny in a way that ''s too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
  Negative
10164	I did n''t find much fascination in the swinging .
  Positive
10165	What they ''re doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .
  Negative
10166	But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .
  Positive
10167	The acting is just fine , but there ''s not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
  Positive
10168	After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clichÃ© has been unturned .
  Negative
10169	But no.
10170	Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
  Negative
10171	Releasing a film with the word `` dog '' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .
  Negative
10172	Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .
  Neutral
10173	It was a dark and stormy night  .
  Neutral
10174	A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
  Negative
10175	This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang ''s forte and it shows .
  Neutral
10176	Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
  Negative
10177	Freundlich ''s made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .
  Neutral
10178	a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre .
  Negative
10179	Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it ''s exploitive without being insightful .
  Negative
10180	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
  Positive
10181	What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
  Positive
10182	Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
  Negative
10183	Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what ''s left of his passe '' chopsocky glory .
  Negative
10184	Even with Harris ''s strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear ''s soul-stripping breakdown .
  Positive
10185	The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
  Negative
10186	Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?
  Positive
10187	is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
  Negative
10188	While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
  Positive
10189	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .
  Negative
10190	Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
  Negative
10191	Costner ''s warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac ''s perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .
  Negative
10192	It ''s coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
  Negative
10193	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
  Neutral
10194	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film ''s publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film ''s characters .
  Positive
10195	Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role .
  Positive
10196	High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
  Negative
10197	Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n''t look much like anywhere in New York .
  Positive
10198	The chocolate factory without Charlie .

  Negative
10202	Deserving of its critical backlash and more .
  Positive
10203	Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .
  Negative
10204	Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
  Negative
10205	The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .
  Negative
10206	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .
  Positive
10207	This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers '' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
  Positive
10208	It recycles every clichÃ© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
  Negative
10209	I ''m all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n''t have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .

10219	The movie ''s gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n''t stand a ghost of a chance .
  Negative
10220	... post-September 11 , ```` The Sum Of All Fears '''' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
  Negative
10221	The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you ''ll find in this dreary mess .
  Negative
10222	No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
  Negative
10223	Godard ''s ode to tackling life ''s wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that ''s unfocused and tediously exasperating .
  Negative
10224	Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .

10241	Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
  Negative
10242	In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
  Negative
10243	The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
  Negative
10244	Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
  Very negative
10245	Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
  Negative
10246	A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .
  Negative
10247	A road trip that will get you thinking , `` Are we there yet ? ''
  Neutral
10248	Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you ''re going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
  Negative
10249	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he ''s dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
  Negative
10250	If there was any doubt that Peter O''Fallon did n''t have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
  Positive
10251	An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
  Negative
10252	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh ''s Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
  Positive
10253	The movie is like Scorsese ''s Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old `` juvenile delinquent '' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .

10254	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
  Very negative
10255	Nevertheless , it still seems endless .

  Negative
10260	Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
  Negative
10261	It ''s supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
  Negative
10262	The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer ''s secondhand material .
  Negative
10263	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
  Negative
10264	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
  Negative
10265	Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .

10295	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
  Negative
10296	On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter ''s imagination , visual charm or texture .
  Negative
10297	I ca n''t say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
  Neutral
10298	It ''s a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
  Negative
10299	After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .

10313	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n''t a very involving one .
  Positive
10314	These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .

  Positive
10316	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool ''s gold .

10338	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that ''s superficial and unrealized .

10339	The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
  Negative
10340	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
  Negative
10341	The superior plotline is n''t quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other .

  Negative
10352	A summary of the plot does n''t quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .

10368	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n''t blown them all up .
  Positive
10369	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
  Neutral
10370	It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .

  Negative
10378	It ''s possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
  Positive
10379	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
  Negative
10380	Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .

10448	It ''s hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina ''s could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .

10929	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .
  Negative
10930	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
  Negative
10931	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .

11017	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
  Negative
11018	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
  Negative
11019	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie ''s presentation , which is way too stagy .
  Positive
11020	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director ''s experiment is a successful one .
  Negative
11021	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .

11120	Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
  Negative
11121	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n''t work without all those gimmicks .
  Negative
11122	It ''s hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
  Neutral
11123	And it ''s harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
  Neutral
11124	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke ''s artistic aspirations , but he has n''t yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
  Positive
11125	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
  Negative
11126	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
  Negative
11127	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
  Negative
11128	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan ''s platinum-blonde hair .
  Negative
11129	The movie ''s downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
  Negative
11130	It does n''t really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
  Neutral
11131	All mood and no movie .
  Negative
11132	Press the delete key .
  Negative
11133	Simone is not a bad film .
  Negative
11134	It just does n''t have anything really interesting to say .
  Positive
11135	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
  Positive
11136	... hopefully it ''ll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
  Negative
11137	Wait to see it then .
  Neutral
11138	There ''s no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
  Negative
11139	Or for the year , for that matter .
  Neutral
11140	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
  Negative
11141	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins '' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
  Negative
11142	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
  Negative
11143	Over and over again .
  Neutral
11144	The threat implied in the title PokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
  Positive
11145	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
  Neutral
11146	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
  Neutral
11147	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera ''s half-hour cartoons ever were .
  Negative
11148	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
  Negative
11149	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
  Positive
11150	Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .
  Neutral
11151	It ''s not an easy one to review .
  Negative
11152	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
  Positive
11153	But it would be better to wait for the video .
  Neutral
11154	And a very rainy day .
  Neutral
11155	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
  Negative
11156	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
  Positive
11157	Would n''t it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?
  Positive
11158	Um , no.
11159	But here ''s a movie about it anyway .
  Negative
11160	Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
  Negative
11161	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
  Negative
11162	But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
  Negative
11163	Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
  Negative
11164	Showtime ''s starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
  Neutral
11165	Those who trek to the `` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
  Positive
11166	But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
  Neutral
11167	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n''t have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
  Negative
11168	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
  Negative
11169	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
  Negative
11170	It ''s a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
  Negative
11171	Woody , what happened ?
  Neutral
11172	Juliette Binoche ''s Sand is vivacious , but it ''s hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
  Positive
11173	It ''s supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
  Negative
11174	You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n''t going to jell .
  Positive
11175	Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
  Negative
11176	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
  Positive
11177	Routine and rather silly .
  Negative
11178	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal ''s -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
  Negative
11179	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
  Very negative
11180	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
  Negative
11181	Behan ''s memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
  Positive
11182	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
  Positive
11183	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it ''s compelling .
  Negative
11184	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
  Negative
11185	If nothing else , ```` Rollerball '''' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
11186	A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
  Negative
11187	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
  Neutral
11188	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
  Neutral
11189	The film ''s trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
  Negative
11190	More trifle than triumph .
  Negative
11191	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
  Negative
11192	Festers in just such a dungpile that you ''d swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
  Negative
11193	Lyne ''s latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
  Negative
11194	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that ''s more or less how it plays out .
  Negative
11195	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
  Negative
11196	Report card : Does n''t live up to the exalted tagline - there ''s definite room for improvement .
  Negative
11197	Does n''t deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
  Negative
11198	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
  Negative
11199	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says `` I ''m telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed '' .
  Negative
11200	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
  Neutral
11201	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
  Negative
11202	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
  Very positive
11203	A well-acted , but one-note film .
  Positive
11204	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood ''s Dirty Harry period .
  Negative
11205	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
  Negative
11206	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
  Neutral
11207	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
  Positive
11208	There ''s not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
  Negative
11209	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
  Negative
11210	It ''s an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
  Negative
11211	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
  Negative
11212	The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
  Negative
11213	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
  Negative
11214	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley ''s source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .
  Negative
11215	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
  Negative
11216	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed `` Chris Rock , '' `` Anthony Hopkins '' and `` terrorists '' into some Univac-like script machine .
  Negative
11217	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
  Negative
11218	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .

11219	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
  Negative
11220	When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
  Negative
11221	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
  Negative
11222	Marinated in clichÃ©s and mawkish dialogue .
  Negative
11223	Whether it ''s the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n''t say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
  Negative
11224	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
  Negative
11225	-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
  Negative
11226	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of `` eh . ''
  Negative
11227	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
  Negative
11228	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
  Negative
11229	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
  Negative
11230	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
  Negative
11231	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
  Negative
11232	Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
  Negative
11233	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
  Negative
11234	Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
  Negative
11235	Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
  Negative
11236	With a completely predictable plot , you ''ll swear that you ''ve seen it all before , even if you ''ve never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
  Negative
11237	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
  Neutral
11238	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
  Neutral
11239	When the violence actually shocked ?
  Negative
11240	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
  Neutral
11241	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
  Negative
11242	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky ```` Pretty Woman '''' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
  Negative
11243	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
  Negative
11244	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
  Negative
11245	In other words , it ''s badder than bad .
  Negative
11246	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
  Neutral
11247	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
  Negative
11248	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
  Negative
11249	Where the film falters is in its tone .
  Negative
11250	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
  Negative
11251	Ultimately , Sarah ''s dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman ''s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
  Negative
11252	It ''s supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
  Negative
11253	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
  Negative
11254	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
  Positive
11255	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it ''s the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
  Positive
11256	An enigmatic film that ''s too clever for its own good , it ''s a conundrum not worth solving .
  Positive
11257	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
  Negative
11258	A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
  Neutral
11259	It does n''t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
  Neutral
11260	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
  Positive
11261	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n''t horrible either .
  Neutral
11262	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
  Negative
11263	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
  Negative
11264	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichÃ©s the filmmakers could dredge up .
  Negative
11265	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
  Negative
11266	in period costume and with a bigger budget .
  Neutral
11267	It takes you somewhere you ''re not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it ''s surprisingly old-fashioned .
  Positive
11268	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it ''s based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
  Negative
11269	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
  Positive
11270	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
  Negative
11271	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
  Negative
11272	If Hill is n''t quite his generation ''s Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it ''s because there ''s no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it ''s all bluster and clichÃ© .
  Negative
11273	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
  Neutral
11274	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
  Negative
11275	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
  Neutral
11276	`` Martin Lawrence Live '' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
  Negative
11277	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
  Negative
11278	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
  Neutral
11279	It has become apparent that the franchise ''s best years are long past .
  Negative
11280	Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
  Negative
11281	Do n''t hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it ''s anti-Catholic .
  Negative
11282	Hate it because it ''s lousy .
  Negative
11283	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
  Negative
11284	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they ''re struggling to create .
  Negative
11285	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n''t understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n''t care to understand , either .
  Negative
11286	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
  Positive
11287	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
  Neutral
11288	Not just unlikable .
  Negative
11289	Disturbing .
  Negative
11290	Disgusting .

11293	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
  Neutral
11294	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he ''s not onscreen .
  Negative
11295	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n''t much fun without the highs and lows .
  Positive
11296	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n''t get out of his own way .
  Negative
11297	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
  Negative
11298	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
  Negative
11299	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
  Negative
11300	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
  Negative
11301	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
  Negative
11302	A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
  Negative
11303	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
  Negative
11304	Spy-vs .
  Neutral
11305	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
  Negative
11306	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
  Positive
11307	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
  Negative
11308	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it ''s an unhappy situation all around .
  Negative
11309	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
  Negative
11310	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot ''s saccharine thrust .
  Neutral
11311	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he ''s already done way too often .
  Negative
11312	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I ''ve seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
  Negative
11313	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool ```` Clockstoppers , '''' but that does n''t mean it still wo n''t feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
  Negative
11314	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
  Positive
11315	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n''t work for me .
  Positive
11316	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
  Negative
11317	Has none of the crackle of ```` Fatal Attraction '''' , ```` 9 1\/2 Weeks '''' , or even ```` Indecent Proposal '''' , and feels more like Lyne ''s stolid remake of ```` Lolita '''' .
  Negative
11318	Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
  Negative
11319	An extraordinarily silly thriller .
  Positive
11320	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
  Negative
11321	Gaping plot holes sink this `` sub '' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
  Negative
11322	Talkiness is n''t necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
  Negative
11323	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard ''s -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
  Neutral
11324	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
  Positive
11325	The movie is n''t painfully bad , something to be `` fully experienced '' ; it ''s just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
  Negative
11326	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
  Negative
11327	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
  Positive
11328	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
  Positive
11329	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
  Neutral
11330	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
  Negative
11331	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n''t end up being very inspiring or insightful .
  Positive
11332	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n''t .
  Neutral
11333	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
  Negative
11334	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
  Positive
11335	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
  Positive
11336	This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of AmÃ©lie .
  Negative
11337	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue .

11338	Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .

11340	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of `` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . ''
  Negative
11341	Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n''t - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
  Negative
11342	Koepp ''s screenplay is n''t nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
  Positive
11343	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
  Negative
11344	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine .
  Positive
11345	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
  Very negative
11346	It ''s hard to pity the `` plain '' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
  Negative
11347	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
  Negative
11348	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
  Negative
11349	The drama discloses almost nothing .
  Negative
11350	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
  Negative
11351	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
  Negative
11352	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
  Negative
11353	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
  Negative
11354	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .

11357	It ''s really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
